OK, so that's the statement.</span> <span m="72000">And, just to clarify a little bit, so, again,</span> <span m="78000">we've seen various kinds of integrals.</span> <span m="84000">So, line integrals we know how to evaluate.</span> <span m="86000">They take place in a curve. You express everything in terms</span> <span m="90000">of one variable, and after substituting,</span> <span m="92000">you end up with a usual one variable integral that you know</span> <span m="96000">how to evaluate. And, surface integrals,</span> <span m="100000">we know also how to evaluate. Namely, we've seen various</span> <span m="104000">formulas for ndS. Once you have such a formula,</span> <span m="107000">due to the dot product with this vector field,</span> <span m="110000">which is not the same as that one.</span> <span m="112000">But it's a new vector field that you can build out of f.</span> <span m="116000">You do the dot product. You express everything in terms</span> <span m="120000">of your two integration variables, and then you</span> <span m="123000">evaluate. So, now, what does this have to</span> <span m="126000">do with various other things? So, one thing I want to say has</span> <span m="132000">to do with how Stokes helps us understand path independence,</span> <span m="138000">so, how it actually motivates our criterion for gradient</span> <span m="144000">fields, independence.</span> <span m="150000">OK, so, we've seen that if we have a</span> <span m="155000">vector field defined in a simply connected region,</span> <span m="160000">and its curl is zero, then it's a gradient field,</span> <span m="163000">and the line integral is path independent.</span> <span m="167000">So, let me first define for you when a simply connected region</span> <span m="173000">is. So, we say that a region in</span> <span m="181000">space is simply connected -- -- if every closed loop inside this</span> <span m="197000">region bounds some surface again inside this region.</span> <span m="211000">OK, so let me just give you some examples just to clarify.</span> <span m="219000">So, for example, let's say that I have a region</span> <span m="226000">that's the entire space with the origin removed.</span> <span m="232000">OK, so space with the origin removed, OK, you think it's</span> <span m="240000">simply connected? Who thinks it's simply</span> <span m="246000">connected? Who thinks it's not simply</span> <span m="249000">connected? Let's think a little bit harder.</span> <span m="254000">Let's say that I take a loop like this one,</span> <span m="257000">OK, it doesn't go through the origin.</span> <span m="260000">Can I find a surface that's bounded by this loop and that</span> <span m="264000">does not pass through the origin?</span> <span m="266000">Yeah, I can take the sphere, you know, for example,</span> <span m="270000">or anything that's just not quite the disk?</span> <span m="274000">So, and similarly,</span> <span m="276000">if I take any other loop that avoids the origin,</span> <span m="279000">I can find, actually, a surface bounded by it that</span> <span m="282000">does not pass through the origin.</span> <span m="284000">So, actually, that's kind of a not so obvious</span> <span m="287000">theorem to prove, but maybe intuitively,</span> <span m="289000">start by finding any surface. Well, if that surface passes</span> <span m="292000">through the origin, just wiggle it a little bit,</span> <span m="294000">you can make sure it doesn't pass through the origin anymore.</span> <span m="296000">Just push it a little bit. So, in fact,</span> <span m="300000">this is simply connected. That was a trick question.</span> <span m="308000">OK, now on the other hand, a good example of something</span> <span m="313000">that is not simply connected is if I take space,</span> <span m="316000">and I remove the z axis -- -- that is not simply connected.</span> <span m="336000">And, see, the reason is, if I look again, say,</span> <span m="339000">at the unit circle in the x axis,</span> <span m="344000">sorry, unit circle in the xy plane,</span> <span m="347000">I mean, in the xy plane, so, if I try to find a surface</span> <span m="352000">whose boundary is this disk, well, it has to actually cross</span> <span m="358000">the z axis somewhere. There's no way that I can find</span> <span m="363000">a surface whose only boundary is this curve, which doesn't hit</span> <span m="369000">the z axis anywhere. Of course, you could try to use</span> <span m="373000">the same trick as there, say, maybe we want to go up,</span> <span m="377000">up, up. You know, let's start with a</span> <span m="379000">cylinder. Well, the problem is you have</span> <span m="381000">to go infinitely far because the z axis goes infinitely far.</span> <span m="384000">And, you'll never be able to actually close your surface.</span> <span m="387000">So, the matter what kind of trick you might want to use,</span> <span m="390000">it's actually a theorem in topology that you cannot find a</span> <span m="394000">surface bounded by this disk without intersecting the z axis.</span> <span m="399000">Yes? Well, a doughnut shape</span> <span m="404000">certainly would stay away from the z axis, but it wouldn't be a</span> <span m="407000">surface with boundary just this guy.</span> <span m="410000">Right, it would have to have either some other boundary.</span> <span m="413000">So, maybe what you have in mind is some sort of doughnut shape</span> <span m="417000">like this that curves on itself, and maybe comes back.</span> <span m="421000">Well, if you don't quite close it all the way around,</span> <span m="425000">so I can try to, indeed, draw some sort of</span> <span m="427000">doughnut here. Well, if I don't quite close</span> <span m="430000">it, that it will have another edge at the other end wherever I</span> <span m="433000">started. If I close it completely,</span> <span m="435000">then this curve is no longer its boundary because my surface</span> <span m="438000">lives on both sides of this curve.</span> <span m="440000">See, I want a surface that stops on this curve,</span> <span m="442000">and doesn't go beyond it. And, nowhere else does it have</span> <span m="445000">that kind of behavior. Everywhere else,</span> <span m="448000">it keeps going on. So,</span> <span m="453000">actually, I mean, maybe actually another way to</span> <span m="456000">convince yourself is to find a counter example to the statement</span> <span m="460000">I'm going to make about vector fields with curl zero and simply</span> <span m="464000">connected regions always being conservative.</span> <span m="468000">So, what you can do is you can take the example that we had in</span> <span m="472000">one of our older problem sets. That was a vector field in the</span> <span m="475000">plane. But, you can also use it to</span> <span m="478000">define a vector field in space just with no z component.</span> <span m="482000">That vector field is actually defined everywhere except on the</span> <span m="485000">z axis, and it violates the usual theorem that we would</span> <span m="488000">expect. So, that's one way to check</span> <span m="492000">just for sure that this thing is not simply connected.</span> <span m="500000">So, what's the statement I want to make?</span> <span m="506000">So, recall we've seen if F is a gradient field -- -- then its</span> <span m="520000">curl is zero. That's just the fact that the</span> <span m="526000">mixed second partial derivatives are equal.</span> <span m="529000">So, now, the converse is the following theorem.</span> <span m="533000">It says if the curl of F equals zero in, sorry,</span> <span m="541000">and F is defined -- No, is not the logical in which to</span> <span m="549000">say it. So, if F is defined in a simply</span> <span m="555000">connected region, and curl F is zero -- -- then F</span> <span m="570000">is a gradient field, and the line integral for F is</span> <span m="585000">path independent -- -- F is conservative,</span> <span m="593000">and so on, all the usual consequences.</span> <span m="595000">Remember, these are all equivalent to each other,</span> <span m="598000">for example, because you can use path</span> <span m="601000">independence to define the potential by doing the line</span> <span m="605000">integral of F. OK, so where do we use the</span> <span m="608000">assumption of being defined in a simply connected region?</span> <span m="612000">Well, the way which we will prove this is to use Stokes</span> <span m="617000">theorem. OK, so the proof,</span> <span m="620000">so just going to prove that the line integral is path</span> <span m="625000">independent; the others work the same way.</span> <span m="629000">OK, so let's assume that we have a vector field whose curl</span> <span m="634000">is zero. And, let's say that we have two</span> <span m="638000">curves, C1 and C2, that go from some point P0 to</span> <span m="644000">some point P1, the same point to the same</span> <span m="649000">point. Well, we'd like to understand</span> <span m="654000">the line integral along C1, say, minus the line integral</span> <span m="660000">along C2 to show that this is zero.</span> <span m="664000">That's what we are trying to prove.</span> <span m="666000">So, how will we compute that? Well, the line integral along</span> <span m="672000">C1 minus C2, well, let's just form a closed curve</span> <span m="677000">that is C1 minus C2. OK, so let's call C,</span> <span m="684000">woops -- So that's equal to the integral along C of f dot dr</span> <span m="696000">where C is C1 followed by C2 backwards.</span> <span m="704000">Now, C is a closed curve. So, I can use Stokes theorem.</span> <span m="710000">Well, to be able to use Stokes theorem, I need,</span> <span m="712000">actually, to find a surface to apply it to.</span> <span m="714000">And, that's where the assumption of simply connected</span> <span m="717000">is useful. I know in advance that any</span> <span m="720000">closed curve, so, C in particular,</span> <span m="722000">has to bound some surface. OK, so we can find S,</span> <span m="730000">a surface, S, that bounds C because the</span> <span m="741000">region is simply connected. So, now that tells us we can</span> <span m="752000">actually apply Stokes theorem, except it won't fit here.</span> <span m="758000">So, instead, I will do that on the next</span> <span m="760000">line. That's equal by Stokes to the</span> <span m="765000">double integral over S of curl F dot vector dS,</span> <span m="771000">or ndS. But now, the curl is zero.</span> <span m="774000">So, if I integrate zero, I will get zero.</span> <span m="778000">OK, so I proved that my two line integrals along C1 and C2</span> <span m="782000">are equal. But for that,</span> <span m="784000">I needed to be able to find a surface which to apply Stokes</span> <span m="788000">theorem. And that required my region to</span> <span m="791000">be simply connected. If I had a vector field that</span> <span m="794000">was defined only outside of the z axis and I took two paths that</span> <span m="797000">went on one side and the other side of the z axis,</span> <span m="800000">I might have obtained, actually,</span> <span m="801000">different values of the line integral.</span> <span m="807000">OK, so anyway, that's the customary warning</span> <span m="815000">about simply connected things. OK, let me just mention very</span> <span m="823000">quickly that there's a lot of interesting topology you can do,</span> <span m="826000">actually in space. So, for example,</span> <span m="828000">this concept of being simply connected or not,</span> <span m="830000">and studying which loops bound surfaces or not can be used to</span> <span m="835000">classify shapes of things inside space.</span> <span m="838000">So, for example, one of the founding</span> <span m="847000">achievements of topology in the 19th century was to classify</span> <span m="855000">surfaces in space -- -- by trying to look at loops on them.</span> <span m="864000">So, what I mean by that is that if I take the surface of a</span> <span m="873000">sphere, well, I claim the surface of a sphere</span> <span m="879000">-- -- is simply connected. Why is that?</span> <span m="884000">Well, let's take my favorite closed curve on the surface of a</span> <span m="889000">sphere. I can always find a portion of</span> <span m="893000">the sphere that's bounded by it. OK, so that's the definition of</span> <span m="899000">the surface of a sphere being simply connected.</span> <span m="903000">On the other hand, if I take what's called a</span> <span m="906000">torus, or if you prefer,</span> <span m="907000">the surface of a doughnut, that's more,</span> <span m="910000">it's a less technical term, but it's -- -- well,</span> <span m="921000">that's not simply connected. And, in fact,</span> <span m="924000">for example, if you look at this loop here</span> <span m="926000">that goes around it, well, of course it bounds a</span> <span m="929000">surface in space. But, that surface cannot be</span> <span m="932000">made to be just a piece of the donut.</span> <span m="935000">You have to go through the hole. You have to leave the surface</span> <span m="939000">of a torus. In fact, there's another one.</span> <span m="941000">See, this one also does not bound anything that's completely</span> <span m="947000">contained in the torus. And, of course,</span> <span m="950000">it bounds this disc, but inside of a torus.</span> <span m="953000">But, that's not a part of the surface itself.</span> <span m="956000">So, in fact, there's, and topologists would</span> <span m="962000">say, there's two independent -- -- loops that don't bound</span> <span m="969000">surfaces, that don't bound anything.</span> <span m="975000">And, so this number two is somehow an invariant that you</span> <span m="978000">can associate to this kind of shape.</span> <span m="980000">And then, if you consider more complicated surfaces with more</span> <span m="983000">holes in them, you can try, somehow,</span> <span m="984000">to count independent loops on them,</span> <span m="987000">and that's the beginning of the classification of surfaces.</span> <span m="993000">Anyway, that's not really an 18.02 topic, but I thought I</span> <span m="999000">would mentioned it because it's kind of a cool idea.</span> <span m="1005000">OK, let me say a bit more in the way of fun remarks like</span> <span m="1015000">that. So, food for thought:</span> <span m="1019000">let's say that I want to apply Stokes theorem to simplify a</span> <span m="1025000">line integral along the curve here.</span> <span m="1028000">So, this curve is maybe not easy to see in the picture.</span> <span m="1031000">It kind of goes twice around the z axis, but spirals up and</span> <span m="1037000">then down. OK, so one way to find a</span> <span m="1040000">surface that's bounded by this curve is to take what's called</span> <span m="1045000">the Mobius strip. OK, so the Mobius strip,</span> <span m="1049000">it's a one sided strip where when you go around,</span> <span m="1052000">you flip one side becomes the other.</span> <span m="1055000">So, you just, if you want to take a band of</span> <span m="1058000">paper and glue the two sides with a twist,</span> <span m="1061000">so, it's a one sided surface. And, that gives us,</span> <span m="1064000">actually, serious trouble if we try to orient it to apply Stokes</span> <span m="1069000">theorem. So, see, for example,</span> <span m="1073000">if I take this Mobius strip, and I try to find an</span> <span m="1078000">orientation, so here it looks like that,</span> <span m="1084000">well, let's say that I've oriented my curve going in this</span> <span m="1088000">direction. So, I go around,</span> <span m="1091000">around, around, still going this direction.</span> <span m="1093000">Well, the orientation I should have for Stokes theorem is that</span> <span m="1099000">when I, so, curve continues here.</span> <span m="1102000">Well, if you look at the convention around here,</span> <span m="1106000">it tells us that the normal vector should be going this way.</span> <span m="1111000">OK, if we look at it near here, if we walk along this way,</span> <span m="1115000">the surface is to our right . So, we should actually be</span> <span m="1117000">flipping things upside down. The normal vector should be</span> <span m="1120000">going down. And, in fact,</span> <span m="1121000">if you try to follow your normal vector that's pointing</span> <span m="1124000">up, it's pointing up, up, up.</span> <span m="1125000">It will have to go into things, into, into, down.</span> <span m="1129000">There's no way to choose consistently a normal vector for</span> <span m="1133000">the Mobius strip. So, that's what we call a</span> <span m="1141000">non-orientable surface. And, that just means it has</span> <span m="1148000">only one side. And, if it has only one side,</span> <span m="1150000">that we cannot speak of flux for it because we have no way of</span> <span m="1154000">saying that we'll be counting things positively one way,</span> <span m="1157000">negatively the other way, because there's only one,</span> <span m="1159000">you know, there's no notion of sides.</span> <span m="1162000">So, you can't define a side towards which things will be</span> <span m="1166000">going positively. So, that's actually a situation</span> <span m="1174000">where flux cannot be defined. OK, so as much as Mobius strips</span> <span m="1184000">and climb-bottles are exciting and really cool,</span> <span m="1188000">well, we can't use them in this class because we can't define</span> <span m="1191000">flux through them. So, if we really wanted to</span> <span m="1194000">apply Stokes theorem, because I've been telling you</span> <span m="1197000">that space is simply connected, and I will always be able to</span> <span m="1199000">apply Stokes theorem to any curve,</span> <span m="1201000">what would I do? Well, I claim this curve</span> <span m="1205000">actually bounds another surface that is orientable.</span> <span m="1210000">Yeah, that looks counterintuitive.</span> <span m="1211000">Well, let's see it. I claim you can take a</span> <span m="1216000">hemisphere, and you can take a small thing and twist it around.</span> <span m="1222000">So, in case you don't believe me, let me do it again with the</span> <span m="1226000">transparency. Here's my loop,</span> <span m="1228000">and see, well, the scale is not exactly the</span> <span m="1231000">same. So, it doesn't quite match.</span> <span m="1233000">But, and it's getting a bit dark.</span> <span m="1235000">But, that spherical thing with a little slit going twisting</span> <span m="1241000">into it will actually have boundary my loop.</span> <span m="1246000">And, that one is orientable. I mean, I leave it up to you to</span> <span m="1250000">stare at the picture long enough to convince yourselves that</span> <span m="1256000">there's a well-defined up and down.</span> <span m="1260000">OK. So now, I mean,</span> <span m="1271000">in case you are getting really, really worried,</span> <span m="1274000">I mean, there won't be any Mobius strips on the exam on</span> <span m="1278000">Tuesday, OK? It's just to show you some cool</span> <span m="1284000">stuff. OK, questions?</span> <span m="1289000">No? OK, one last thing I want to</span> <span m="1294000">show you before we start reviewing,</span> <span m="1298000">so one question you might have about Stokes theorem is,</span> <span m="1301000">how come we can choose whatever surface we want?</span> <span m="1304000">I mean, sure, it seems to work,</span> <span m="1307000">but why? So, I'm going to say a couple</span> <span m="1312000">of words about surface independence in Stokes theorem.</span> <span m="1322000">So, let's say that I have a curve, C, in space.</span> <span m="1328000">And, let's say that I want to apply Stokes theorem.</span> <span m="1331000">So, then I can choose my favorite surface bounded by C.</span> <span m="1336000">So, in a situation like this, for example,</span> <span m="1338000">I might want to make my first choice be this guy,</span> <span m="1341000">S1, like maybe some sort of upper half sphere.</span> <span m="1345000">And, if you pay attention to the orientation conventions,</span> <span m="1348000">you'll see that you need to take it with normal vector</span> <span m="1351000">pointing up. Maybe actually I would rather</span> <span m="1354000">make a different choice. And actually,</span> <span m="1356000">I will choose another surface, S2, that maybe looks like that.</span> <span m="1361000">And, if I look carefully at the orientation convention,</span> <span m="1364000">Stokes theorem tells me that I have to take the normal vector</span> <span m="1367000">pointing up again. So, that's actually into things.</span> <span m="1372000">So, Stokes says that the line</span> <span m="1377000">integral along C of my favorite vector field can be computed</span> <span m="1384000">either as a flux integral for the curl through S1,</span> <span m="1389000">or as the same integral, but through S2 instead of S1.</span> <span m="1396000">So, that seems to suggest that curl F has some sort of surface</span> <span m="1401000">independence property. It doesn't really matter which</span> <span m="1404000">surface I take, as long as the boundary is this</span> <span m="1407000">given curve, C. Why is that?</span> <span m="1409000">That's a strange property to have.</span> <span m="1411000">Where does it come from? Well, let's think about it for</span> <span m="1416000">a second. So, why are these the same?</span> <span m="1420000">I mean, of course, they have to be the same</span> <span m="1422000">because that's what Stokes tell us.</span> <span m="1424000">But, why is that OK? Well, let's think about</span> <span m="1428000">comparing the flux integral for S1 and the flux integral for S2.</span> <span m="1433000">So, if we want to compare them, we should probably subtract</span> <span m="1437000">them from each other. OK, so let's do the flux</span> <span m="1442000">integral for S1 minus the flux integral for S2 of the same</span> <span m="1449000">thing. Well, let's give a name.</span> <span m="1452000">Let's call S the surface S1 minus S2.</span> <span m="1458000">So, what is S? S is S1 with its given</span> <span m="1461000">orientation together with S2 with the reversed orientation.</span> <span m="1466000">So, S is actually this whole closed surface here.</span> <span m="1472000">And, the normal vector to S seems to be pointing outwards</span> <span m="1477000">everywhere. OK, so now, if we have a closed</span> <span m="1479000">surface with a normal vector pointing outwards,</span> <span m="1481000">and we want to find a flux integral for it,</span> <span m="1484000">well, we can replace that with a</span> <span m="1487000">triple integral. So, that's the divergence</span> <span m="1497000">theorem. So, that's by the divergence</span> <span m="1503000">theorem using the fact that S is a closed surface.</span> <span m="1509000">That's equal to the triple integral over the region inside.</span> <span m="1513000">Let me call that region D of divergence, of curl F dV.</span> <span m="1526000">OK, and what I'm going to claim now is that we can actually</span> <span m="1534000">check that if you take the divergence of the curl of a</span> <span m="1541000">vector field, you always get zero.</span> <span m="1547000">OK, and so that will tell you that this integral will always</span> <span m="1550000">be zero. And that's why the flux for S1,</span> <span m="1553000">and the flux for S2 were the same a priori and we didn't have</span> <span m="1558000">to worry about which one we chose when we did Stokes</span> <span m="1561000">theorem. OK, so let's just check quickly</span> <span m="1566000">that divergence of a curve is zero.</span> <span m="1570000">OK, in case you're wondering why I'm doing all this,</span> <span m="1572000">well, first I think it's kind of interesting,</span> <span m="1573000">and second, it reminds you of a statement of all these theorems,</span> <span m="1577000">and all these definitions. So, in a way,</span> <span m="1579000">we are already reviewing. OK, so let's see.</span> <span m="1585000">If my vector field has components P,</span> <span m="1590000">Q, and R, remember that the curl was defined by this cross</span> <span m="1599000">product between del and our given vector field.</span> <span m="1607000">So, that's Ry - Qz followed by Pz - Rx, and Qx - Py.</span> <span m="1624000">So, now, we want to take the divergence of this.</span> <span m="1634000">Well, so we have to take the first component,</span> <span m="1639000">Ry minus Qz, and take its partial with</span> <span m="1643000">respect to x. Then, take the y component,</span> <span m="1648000">Pz minus Rx partial with respect to y plus Qx minus Py</span> <span m="1655000">partial with respect to z. And, well, now we should expand</span> <span m="1661000">this. But I claim it will always</span> <span m="1663000">simplify to zero.</span> <span m="1691000">OK, so I think we have over there, becomes R sub yx minus Q</span> <span m="1704000">sub zx plus P sub zy minus R sub xy plus Q sub xz minus P sub yz.</span> <span m="1719000">Well, let's see. We have P sub zy minus P sub yz.</span> <span m="1727000">These two cancel out. We have R sub yx minus R sub xy.</span> <span m="1734000">These cancel out. Q sub zx and Q sub xz,</span> <span m="1738000">these two also cancel out. So, indeed, the divergence of a</span> <span m="1744000">curl is always zero. OK, so the claim is divergence</span> <span m="1750000">of curl is always zero. Del cross F is always zero,</span> <span m="1757000">and just a small remark, if we had actually real vectors</span> <span m="1766000">rather than this strange del guy,</span> <span m="1770000">indeed we know that if we have two vectors,</span> <span m="1773000">U and V, and we do u dot u cross v,</span> <span m="1777000">what is that? Well, one way to say it is it's</span> <span m="1780000">the determinant of u, u, and v, which is the volume</span> <span m="1783000">of the box. But, it's completely flat</span> <span m="1785000">because u, u, and v are all in the plane</span> <span m="1787000">defined by u and v. The other way to say it is that</span> <span m="1790000">u cross v is perpendicular to u and v.</span> <span m="1793000">Well, if it's perpendicular u, then its dot product with u</span> <span m="1796000">will be zero. So, no matter how you say it,</span> <span m="1799000">this is always zero. So, in a way,</span> <span m="1802000">this reinforces our intuition that del, even though it's not</span> <span m="1809000">at all an actual vector sometimes can be manipulated in</span> <span m="1815000">the same way. OK, I think that's it for new</span> <span m="1820000">topics for today. And,</span> <span m="1826000">so, now I should maybe try to recap quickly what we've learned</span> <span m="1830000">in these past three weeks so that you know,</span> <span m="1834000">so, the exam is probably going to be similar in difficulty to</span> <span m="1839000">the practice exams. That's my goal.</span> <span m="1842000">I don't know if I will have reached that goal or not.</span> <span m="1845000">We'll only know that after you've taken the test.</span> <span m="1848000">But, the idea is it's meant to be more or less the same level</span> <span m="1853000">of difficulty. So, at this point,</span> <span m="1858000">we've learned about three kinds of beasts in space.</span> <span m="1866000">OK, so I'm going to divide my blackboard into three pieces,</span> <span m="1872000">and here I will write triple integrals.</span> <span m="1876000">We've learned about double integrals, and we've learned</span> <span m="1880000">about line integrals. OK, so triple integrals over a</span> <span m="1886000">region in space, we integrate a scalar quantity,</span> <span m="1893000">dV. How do we do that?</span> <span m="1895000">Well, we can do that in rectangular coordinates where dV</span> <span m="1901000">becomes something like, maybe, dz dx dy,</span> <span m="1906000">or any permutation of these. We've seen how to do it also in</span> <span m="1912000">cylindrical coordinates where dV is maybe dz times r dr d theta</span> <span m="1919000">or more commonly r dr d theta dz.</span> <span m="1922000">But, what I want to emphasize in this way is that both of</span> <span m="1926000">these you set up pretty much in the same way.</span> <span m="1929000">So, remember, the main trick here is to find</span> <span m="1932000">the bounds of integration. So, when you do it,</span> <span m="1935000">say, with dz first, that means for fixed xy,</span> <span m="1938000">so, for a fixed point in the xy plane, you have to look at the</span> <span m="1943000">bounds for z. So, that means you have to</span> <span m="1945000">figure out what's the bottom surface of your solid,</span> <span m="1948000">and what's the top surface of your solid?</span> <span m="1951000">And, you have to find the value of z at the bottom,</span> <span m="1954000">the value of z at the top as functions of x and y.</span> <span m="1957000">And then, you will put that as bounds for z.</span> <span m="1960000">Once you've done that, you are left with the question</span> <span m="1963000">of finding bounds for x and y. Well, for that,</span> <span m="1965000">you just rotate the picture, look at your solid from above,</span> <span m="1969000">so, look at its projection to the xy plane,</span> <span m="1972000">and you set up a double integral either in rectangular</span> <span m="1976000">xy coordinates, or in polar coordinates for x</span> <span m="1982000">and y. Of course, you can always do it</span> <span m="1984000">a different orders. And, I'll let you figure out</span> <span m="1988000">again how that goes. But, if you do dz first,</span> <span m="1991000">then the inner bounds are given by bottom and top,</span> <span m="1995000">and the outer ones are given by looking at the shadow of the</span> <span m="2000000">region. Now, there's also spherical</span> <span m="2003000">coordinates. And there, we've seen that dV</span> <span m="2008000">is rho squared sine phi d rho d phi d theta.</span> <span m="2012000">So now, of course, if this orgy of Greek letters</span> <span m="2015000">is confusing you at this point, then you probably need to first</span> <span m="2019000">review spherical coordinates for themselves.</span> <span m="2021000">Remember that rho is the distance from the origin.</span> <span m="2024000">Phi is the angle down from the z axis.</span> <span m="2027000">So, it's zero, and the positive z axis,</span> <span m="2029000">pi over two in the xy plane, and increases all the way to pi</span> <span m="2033000">on the negative z axis. And, theta is the angle around</span> <span m="2039000">the z axis. So, now, when we set up bounds</span> <span m="2042000">here, it will look a lot like what</span> <span m="2044000">you've done in polar coordinates in the plane because when you</span> <span m="2047000">look at the inner bound down on rho,</span> <span m="2049000">for a fixed phi and theta, that means you're shooting a</span> <span m="2052000">straight ray from the origin in some direction in space.</span> <span m="2055000">So, you know, you're sending a laser beam,</span> <span m="2057000">and you want to know what part of your beam is going to be in</span> <span m="2060000">your given solid. You want to solve for the value</span> <span m="2063000">of rho when you enter the solid and when you leave it.</span> <span m="2066000">I mean, very often, if the origin is in your solid,</span> <span m="2069000">then rho will start at zero. Then you want to know when you</span> <span m="2073000">exit. And, I mean,</span> <span m="2074000">there's a fairly small list of kinds of surfaces that we've</span> <span m="2078000">seen how to set up in spherical coordinates.</span> <span m="2081000">So, if you're really upset by this, go over the problems in</span> <span m="2084000">the notes. That will give you a good idea</span> <span m="2087000">of what kinds of things we've seen in spherical coordinates.</span> <span m="2093000">OK, and then evaluation is the usual way.</span> <span m="2096000">Questions about this? No?</span> <span m="2101000">OK, so, I should say we can do something bad,</span> <span m="2108000">but so we've seen, of course, applications of</span> <span m="2115000">this. So, we should know how to use a</span> <span m="2119000">triple integral to evaluate things like a mass of a solid,</span> <span m="2124000">the average value of a function,</span> <span m="2129000">the moment of inertia about one of the coordinate axes,</span> <span m="2137000">or the gravitational attraction on a mass at the origin.</span> <span m="2154000">OK, so these are just formulas to remember for examples of</span> <span m="2158000">triple integrals. It doesn't change conceptually.</span> <span m="2161000">You always set them up and evaluate them the same way.</span> <span m="2164000">It just tells you what to put there for the integrand.</span> <span m="2171000">Now, double integrals: so,</span> <span m="2175000">when we have a surface in space,</span> <span m="2178000">well, what we will integrate on it,</span> <span m="2181000">at least what we've seen how to integrate is a vector field</span> <span m="2186000">dotted with the unit normal vector times the area element.</span> <span m="2191000">OK, and this is sometimes called vector dS.</span> <span m="2198000">Now, how do we evaluate that? Well, we've seen formulas for</span> <span m="2208000">ndS in various settings. And, once you have a formula</span> <span m="2215000">for ndS, that will relate ndS to maybe dx dy, or something else.</span> <span m="2221000">And then, you will express, so, for example,</span> <span m="2227000">ndS equals something dx dy. And then, it becomes a double</span> <span m="2235000">integral of something dx dy. Now, in the integrand,</span> <span m="2241000">you want to express everything in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="2243000">So, if you had a z, maybe you have a formula for z</span> <span m="2246000">in terms of x and y. And, when you set up the</span> <span m="2248000">bounds, well, you try to figure out what are</span> <span m="2250000">the bounds for x and y? That would be just looking at</span> <span m="2253000">it from above. Of course, if you are using</span> <span m="2255000">other variables, figure out the bounds for those</span> <span m="2257000">variables. And, when you've done that,</span> <span m="2260000">it becomes just a double integral in the usual sense.</span> <span m="2264000">OK, so maybe I should be a bit more explicit about formulas</span> <span m="2266000">because there have been a lot. So, let me tell you about a few</span> <span m="2272000">of them. Let me actually do that over</span> <span m="2276000">here because I don't want to make this too crowded.</span> <span m="2304000">OK, so what kinds of formulas for ndS have we seen?</span> <span m="2308000">Well, we've seen a formula, for example,</span> <span m="2312000">for a horizontal plane, or for something that's</span> <span m="2317000">parallel to the yz plane or the xz plane.</span> <span m="2322000">Well, let's do just the yz plane for a quick reminder.</span> <span m="2327000">So, if I have a surface that's contained inside the yz plane,</span> <span m="2332000">then obviously I will express ds in terms of,</span> <span m="2336000">well, I will use y and z as my variables.</span> <span m="2341000">So, I will say that ds is dy dz, or dz dy,</span> <span m="2345000">whatever's most convenient. Maybe we will even switch to</span> <span m="2351000">polar coordinates after that if a problem wants us to.</span> <span m="2355000">And, what about the normal vector?</span> <span m="2356000">Well, the normal vector is either coming straight at us,</span> <span m="2361000">or it's maybe going back away from us depending on which</span> <span m="2366000">orientation we've chosen. So, this gives us ndS.</span> <span m="2370000">We dot our favorite vector field with it.</span> <span m="2372000">We integrate, and we get the answer.</span> <span m="2378000">OK, we've seen about spheres and cylinders centered at the</span> <span m="2388000">origin or centered on the z axis.</span> <span m="2394000">So, the normal vector sticks straight out or straight in,</span> <span m="2400000">depending on which direction you do it in.</span> <span m="2405000">So, for a sphere, the normal vector is </span> <span m="2409000">y, z&gt; divided by the radius of the sphere.</span> <span m="2414000">For a cylinder, it's </span> <span m="2417000">0&gt;, divided by the radius of a cylinder.</span> <span m="2421000">And, the surface element on a sphere,</span> <span m="2425000">so, see, it's very closely related to the volume element of</span> <span m="2428000">spherical coordinates except you don't have a rho anymore.</span> <span m="2431000">You just plug in a rho equals a. So, you get a squared sine phi</span> <span m="2437000">d phi d theta. And, for a cylinder,</span> <span m="2441000">it would be a dz d theta. So,</span> <span m="2447000">by the way, just a quick check, when you're doing an integral,</span> <span m="2451000">if it's the surface integral, there should be two integral</span> <span m="2455000">signs, and there should be two</span> <span m="2456000">integration variables. And, there should be two d</span> <span m="2459000">somethings. If you end up with a dx,</span> <span m="2463000">dy, dz in the surface integral, something is seriously wrong.</span> <span m="2470000">OK, now, besides these specific formulas, we've seen two general</span> <span m="2478000">formulas that are also useful. So, one is,</span> <span m="2484000">if we know how to express z in terms of x and y,</span> <span m="2489000">and just to change notation to show you that it's not set in</span> <span m="2493000">stone, let's say that z is known as a</span> <span m="2496000">function z of x and y. So, how do I get ndS in that</span> <span m="2502000">case? Well, we've seen a formula that</span> <span m="2505000">says negative partial z partial x, negative partial z partial y,</span> <span m="2511000">one dx dy. So, this formula relates the</span> <span m="2514000">volume, sorry, the surface element on our</span> <span m="2517000">surface to the area element in the xy plane.</span> <span m="2521000">It lets us convert between dS and dx dy.</span> <span m="2528000">OK, so we just plug in this, and we dot with F,</span> <span m="2531000">and then we substitute everything in terms of x and y,</span> <span m="2534000">and we evaluate the integral over x and y.</span> <span m="2537000">If we don't really want to find a way to find z as a function of</span> <span m="2542000">x and y, but we have a normal vector</span> <span m="2549000">given to us, then we have another formula</span> <span m="2555000">which says that ndS is, sorry, I should have said it's</span> <span m="2559000">always up to sign because we have a two orientation</span> <span m="2562000">convention. We have to decide based on what</span> <span m="2565000">we are trying to do, whether we are doing the</span> <span m="2568000">correct convention or the wrong one.</span> <span m="2571000">So, the other formula is n over n dot k dx dy.</span> <span m="2582000">Sorry, are they all the same? Well, if you want,</span> <span m="2589000">you can put an absolute value here.</span> <span m="2592000">But, it doesn't matter because it's up to sign anyway.</span> <span m="2596000">So, I mean, this formula is valid as it is.</span> <span m="2602000">OK, and, I mean, if you're in a situation where</span> <span m="2604000">you can apply more than one formula,</span> <span m="2606000">they will all give you the same answer in the end because it's</span> <span m="2612000">the same flux integral. OK, so anyway,</span> <span m="2617000">so we have various ways of computing surface integrals,</span> <span m="2620000">and probably one of the best possible things you can do to</span> <span m="2624000">prepare for the test is actually to look again at some practice</span> <span m="2628000">problems from the notes that do flux integrals over various</span> <span m="2631000">kinds of surfaces because that's probably one of the hardest</span> <span m="2635000">topics in this unit of the class.</span> <span m="2638000">OK, anyway, let's move on to line integrals.</span> <span m="2645000">So, those are actually a piece of cake in comparison,</span> <span m="2651000">OK, because all that this is, is just integral of P dx Q dy R</span> <span m="2657000">dz. And, then all you have to do is</span> <span m="2664000">parameterize the curve, C, to express everything in</span> <span m="2675000">terms of a single variable. And then, you end up with a</span> <span m="2682000">usual single integral, and you can just compute it.</span> <span m="2686000">So, that one works pretty much as it did in the plane.</span> <span m="2688000">So, if you forgotten what we did in the plane,</span> <span m="2692000">it's really the same thing. OK, so now we have three</span> <span m="2696000">different kinds of integrals, and really, well,</span> <span m="2698000">they certainly have in common that they integrate things</span> <span m="2701000">somehow. But, apart from that,</span> <span m="2703000">they are extremely different in what they do.</span> <span m="2705000">I mean, this one involves a function, a scalar quantity.</span> <span m="2708000">These involve vector quantities. They don't involve the same</span> <span m="2711000">kinds of shapes over which to integrate.</span> <span m="2713000">Here, you integrate over a three-dimensional region.</span> <span m="2716000">Here, you integrate only over a two-dimensional surface,</span> <span m="2719000">and here, only a one-dimensional curve.</span> <span m="2721000">So, try not to confuse them. That's basically the most</span> <span m="2724000">important advice. Don't get mistaken.</span> <span m="2727000">Each of them has a different way of getting evaluated.</span> <span m="2730000">Eventually, they will all give you numbers, but through</span> <span m="2734000">different processes. So now, well,</span> <span m="2736000">I said these guys are completely different.</span> <span m="2738000">Well, they are, but we still have some bridges</span> <span m="2740000">between them. OK, so we have two,</span> <span m="2742000">maybe I should say three, well, two bridges between these</span> <span m="2746000">guys. OK, so we have somehow a</span> <span m="2749000">connection between these which is the divergence theorem.</span> <span m="2754000">We have a connection between that, which is Stokes theorem.</span> <span m="2762000">So -- Just to write them again, so the divergence theorem says</span> <span m="2780000">if I have a region in space, and I call its boundary S,</span> <span m="2785000">so, it's going to be a closed surface,</span> <span m="2787000">and I orient S with a normal vector pointing outwards,</span> <span m="2791000">then whenever I have a surface integral over S,</span> <span m="2795000">sorry, I can replace it by a triple</span> <span m="2800000">integral over the region inside. OK, so this guy is a vector</span> <span m="2807000">field. And, this guy is a function</span> <span m="2809000">that somehow relates to the vector field.</span> <span m="2812000">I mean, you should know how. You should know the definition</span> <span m="2814000">of divergence, of course.</span> <span m="2815000">But, what I want to point out is if you have to compute the</span> <span m="2819000">two sides separately, well, this is just,</span> <span m="2821000">you know, your standard flux integral.</span> <span m="2824000">This is just your standard triple integral over a region in</span> <span m="2827000">space. Once you have computed what</span> <span m="2829000">this guy is, it's really just a triple integral of the function.</span> <span m="2833000">So, the way in which you compute it doesn't see that it</span> <span m="2836000">came from a divergence. It's just the same way that you</span> <span m="2839000">would compute any other triple integral.</span> <span m="2843000">The way we compute it doesn't depend on what actually we are</span> <span m="2848000">integrating. Stokes theorem says if I have a</span> <span m="2852000">curve that's the boundary of a surface, S,</span> <span m="2855000">and I orient the two in compatible manners,</span> <span m="2860000">then I can replace a line integral on C by a surface</span> <span m="2872000">integral on S. OK, and that surface integral,</span> <span m="2877000">well, it's not for the same vector field.</span> <span m="2880000">This relates a line integral for one field to a surface</span> <span m="2883000">integral from another field. That other field is given from</span> <span m="2886000">the first one just by taking its curl So, after you take the</span> <span m="2890000">curl, you obtain a different vector field.</span> <span m="2893000">And, the way in which you would compute the surface integral is</span> <span m="2897000">just as with any surface integral.</span> <span m="2899000">You just find a formula for ndS dot product, substitute,</span> <span m="2903000">evaluate. The calculation of this thing,</span> <span m="2906000">once you've computed curl does not remember that it was a curl.</span> <span m="2910000">It's the same as with any other flux integral.</span> <span m="2913000">OK, and finally, the last bridge,</span> <span m="2915000">so this was between two and three.</span> <span m="2918000">This was between one and two. Let me just say,</span> <span m="2921000">there's a bridge between zero and one,</span> <span m="2925000">which is that if you have a function in its gradient,</span> <span m="2933000">well, the fundamental theorem of calculus says that the line</span> <span m="2937000">integral for the vector field given by the gradient of a</span> <span m="2941000">function is actually equal to the change in value of a</span> <span m="2944000">function. That's if you have a curve</span> <span m="2948000">bounded by P0 and P1. So in a way, actually,</span> <span m="2951000">each of these three theorems relates a quantity with a</span> <span m="2955000">certain number of integral signs to a quantity with one more</span> <span m="2959000">integral sign. And, that's actually somehow a</span> <span m="2962000">fundamental similarity between them.</span> <span m="2964000">But maybe it's easier to think of them as completely different</span> <span m="2967000">stories. So now, with this one,</span> <span m="2970000">we additionally have to remember another topic is given</span> <span m="2976000">a vector field, F, with curl equal to zero,</span> <span m="2981000">find the potential. And, we've seen two methods for</span> <span m="2985000">that, and I'm sure you remember them.</span> <span m="2987000">So, if not, then try to remember them for Tuesday.</span> <span m="2993000">OK, so anyway, again, conceptually,</span> <span m="2994000">we have, really, three different kinds of</span> <span m="2996000">integrals. We evaluated them in completely</span> <span m="2999000">different ways, and we have a handful of</span> <span m="3001000">theorems, connecting them to each other.</span> <span m="3003000">But, that doesn't have any impact on how we actually</span> <span m="3006000">compute things.</span> </p>

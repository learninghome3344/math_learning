Today we have a new topic,</span> <span m="26000">and we are going to start to learn about vector fields and</span> <span m="33000">line integrals. Last week we had been doing</span> <span m="37000">double integrals. For today we just forget all of</span> <span m="41000">that, but don't actually forget it.</span> <span m="43000">Put it away in a corner of your mind.</span> <span m="45000">It is going to come back next week, but what we do today will</span> <span m="48000">include line integrals. And these are completely</span> <span m="51000">different things, so it helps,</span> <span m="52000">actually, if you don't think of double integrals at all while</span> <span m="56000">doing line integrals. Anyway, let's start with vector</span> <span m="59000">fields. What is a vector field?</span> <span m="62000">Well, a vector field is something that is of a form,</span> <span m="69000">while it is a vector, but while M and N,</span> <span m="74000">the components, actually depend on x and y,on</span> <span m="81000">the point where you are. So, they are functions of x and</span> <span m="90000">y. What that means,</span> <span m="92000">concretely, is that every point in the plane you have a vector.</span> <span m="96000">In a corn field, every where you have corn.</span> <span m="99000">In a vector field, everywhere you have a vector.</span> <span m="103000">That is how it works. A good example of a vector</span> <span m="109000">field, I don't know if you have seen these maps that show the</span> <span m="115000">wind, but here are some cool images done by NASA.</span> <span m="119000">Actually, that is a picture of wind patterns off the coast of</span> <span m="124000">California with Santa Ana winds, in case you are wondering what</span> <span m="129000">has been going on recently. You have all of these vectors</span> <span m="133000">that show you the velocity of the air basically at every</span> <span m="137000">point. I mean, of course you don't</span> <span m="138000">draw it every point, because if you drew a vector at</span> <span m="141000">absolutely all the points of a plane then you would just fill</span> <span m="144000">up everything and you wouldn't see anything.</span> <span m="147000">So, choose points and draw the vectors at those points.</span> <span m="153000">Here is another cool image, which is upside down.</span> <span m="158000">That is a hurricane off the coast of Mexico with the winds</span> <span m="164000">spiraling around the hurricane. Anyway, it is kind of hard to</span> <span m="169000">see. You don't really see all the</span> <span m="172000">vectors, actually, because the autofocus is having</span> <span m="177000">trouble with it. It cannot really do it,</span> <span m="183000">so I guess I will go back to the previous one.</span> <span m="191000">Anyway, a vector field is something where at each point --</span> <span m="210000">-- in the plane we have vector F that depends on x and y.</span> <span m="230000">This occurs in real life when you look at velocity fields in a</span> <span m="234000">fluid. For example, the wind.</span> <span m="236000">That is what these pictures show.</span> <span m="238000">At every point you have a velocity of a fluid that is</span> <span m="241000">moving. Another example is force fields.</span> <span m="244000">Now, force fields are not something out of Star Wars.</span> <span m="248000">If you look at gravitational attraction,</span> <span m="250000">you know that if you have a mass somewhere,</span> <span m="253000">well, it will be attracted to fall down because of the gravity</span> <span m="256000">field of the earth, which means that at every point</span> <span m="258000">you have a vector that is pointing down.</span> <span m="261000">And, the same thing in space, you have the gravitational</span> <span m="264000">field of planets, stars and so on.</span> <span m="267000">That is also an example of a vector field because,</span> <span m="269000">wherever you go, you would have that vector.</span> <span m="272000">And what it is depends on where you are.</span> <span m="277000">The examples from the real world are things like velocity</span> <span m="285000">in a fluid or force field where you have a force that depends on</span> <span m="294000">the point where you are. We are going to try to study</span> <span m="301000">vector fields mathematically. We won't really care what they</span> <span m="305000">are most of the time, but, as we will explore with</span> <span m="308000">them defined quantities and so on,</span> <span m="310000">we will very often use these motivations to justify why we</span> <span m="315000">would care about certain quantities.</span> <span m="318000">The first thing we have to figure out is how do we draw a</span> <span m="324000">vector field, you know, how do you generate a</span> <span m="328000">plot like that? Let's practice drawing a few</span> <span m="333000">vector fields. Well, let's say our very first</span> <span m="338000">vector field will be just 2i j. It is kind of a silly vector</span> <span m="343000">field because it doesn't actually depend on x and y.</span> <span m="345000">That means it is the same vector everywhere.</span> <span m="349000">I take a plane and take vector .</span> <span m="357000">I guess it points in that direction.</span> <span m="359000">It is two units to the right and one up.</span> <span m="361000">And I just put that vector everywhere.</span> <span m="369000">You just put it at a few points all over the place.</span> <span m="373000">And when you think you have enough so that you understand</span> <span m="376000">what is going on then you stop. Here probably we don't need</span> <span m="379000">that many. I mean here I think we get the</span> <span m="384000">picture. Everywhere we have a vector</span> <span m="390000">. Now, let's try to look at</span> <span m="395000">slightly more interesting examples.</span> <span m="397000">Let's say I give you a vector field x times i hat.</span> <span m="402000">There is no j component. How would you draw that?</span> <span m="415000">Well, first of all, we know that this guy is only</span> <span m="420000">in the i direction so it is always horizontal.</span> <span m="425000">It doesn't have a j component. Everywhere it would be a</span> <span m="428000">horizontal vector. Now, the question is how long</span> <span m="430000">is it? Well, how long it is depends on</span> <span m="435000">x. For example,</span> <span m="436000">if x is zero then this will actually be the zero vector.</span> <span m="440000">x is zero here on the y-axis. I will take a different color.</span> <span m="448000">If I am on the y-axis, I actually have the zero</span> <span m="453000">vector. Now, if x becomes positive</span> <span m="456000">small then I will have actually a small positive multiple of i</span> <span m="461000">so I will be going a little bit to the right.</span> <span m="465000">And then, if I increase x, this guy becomes larger so I</span> <span m="471000">get a longer vector to the right.</span> <span m="474000">If x is negative then my vector field points to the left</span> <span m="483000">instead. It looks something like that.</span> <span m="490000">Any questions about that picture?</span> <span m="496000">No. OK.</span> <span m="497000">Usually, we are not going to try to have very accurate,</span> <span m="500000">you know, we won't actually take time to plot a vector field</span> <span m="503000">very carefully. I mean, if we need to,</span> <span m="506000">computers can do it for us. It is useful to have an idea of</span> <span m="510000">what a vector field does roughly.</span> <span m="512000">Whether it is getting larger and larger, in what direction it</span> <span m="516000">is pointing, what are the general features?</span> <span m="519000">Just to do a couple of more, actually, you will see very</span> <span m="525000">quickly that the examples I use in lecture are pretty much</span> <span m="530000">always the same ones. We will be playing a lot with</span> <span m="535000">these particular vector fields just because they are good</span> <span m="539000">examples. Let's say I give you xi yj.</span> <span m="544000">That one has an interesting geometric significance.</span> <span m="548000">If I take a point (x, y), there I want to take a</span> <span m="556000">vector x, y. How do I do that?</span> <span m="560000">Well, it is the same as a vector from the origin to this</span> <span m="563000">point. I take this vector and I copy</span> <span m="567000">it so that it starts at one point.</span> <span m="570000">It looks like that. And the same thing at every</span> <span m="580000">point. It is a vector field that is</span> <span m="585000">pointing radially away from the origin, and its magnitude</span> <span m="593000">increases with distance from the origin.</span> <span m="599000">You don't have to draw as many as me, but the idea is this</span> <span m="603000">vector field everywhere points away from the origin.</span> <span m="608000">And its magnitude is equal to the distance from the origin.</span> <span m="614000">If these were, for example,</span> <span m="615000">velocity fields, well, you would see visually</span> <span m="618000">what is happening to your fluid. Like here maybe you have a</span> <span m="623000">source at the origin that is pouring fluid out and it is</span> <span m="628000">flowing all the way away from that.</span> <span m="632000">Let's do just a last one. Let's say I give you minus y, x.</span> <span m="645000">What does that look like? That is an interesting one,</span> <span m="655000">actually. Let's say that I have a point</span> <span m="661000">(x, y) here. This vector here is </span> <span m="666000">y&gt;. But the vector I want is &lt;-</span> <span m="670000">y, x&gt;. What does that look like?</span> <span m="674000">It is perpendicular to the position to this vector.</span> <span m="678000">If I rotate this vector, let me maybe draw a picture on</span> <span m="684000">the side, and take vector x, y.</span> <span m="688000">A vector with components negative y and x is going to be</span> <span m="696000">like this. It is the vector that I get by</span> <span m="703000">rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise.</span> <span m="710000">And, of course, I do not want to put that</span> <span m="711000">vector at the origin. I want to put it at the point</span> <span m="714000">x, y. In fact, what I will draw is</span> <span m="717000">something like this. And similarly here like that,</span> <span m="726000">like that, etc. And if I am closer to the</span> <span m="733000">origin then it looks a bit the same, but it is shorter.</span> <span m="739000">And at the origin it is zero. And when I am further away it</span> <span m="743000">becomes even larger. See, this vector field,</span> <span m="747000">if it was the motion of a fluid,</span> <span m="749000">it would correspond to a fluid that is just going around the</span> <span m="756000">origin in circles rotating at uniform speed.</span> <span m="761000">This is actually the velocity field for uniform rotation.</span> <span m="774000">And, if you figure out how long it takes for a particle of fluid</span> <span m="781000">to go all the way around, that would be actually 2(pi)</span> <span m="786000">because the length of a circle is 2(pi) times the radius.</span> <span m="790000">That is actually at unit angular velocity,</span> <span m="796000">one radiant per second or per unit time.</span> <span m="801000">That is why this guy comes up quite a lot in real life.</span> <span m="809000">And you can imagine lots of variations on these.</span> <span m="813000">Of course, you can also imagine vector fields given by much more</span> <span m="816000">complicated formulas, and then you would have a hard</span> <span m="818000">time drawing them. Maybe you will use a computer</span> <span m="820000">or maybe you will just give up and just do whatever calculation</span> <span m="824000">you have to do without trying to visualize the vector field.</span> <span m="827000">But if you have a nice simple one then it is worth doing it</span> <span m="831000">because sometimes it will give you insight about what you are</span> <span m="836000">going to compute next. Any questions first about these</span> <span m="842000">pictures? No.</span> <span m="847000">OK. Oh, yes?</span> <span m="857000">You are asking if it should be y, negative x.</span> <span m="862000">I think it would be the other way around.</span> <span m="866000">See, for example, if I am at this point then y is</span> <span m="870000">positive and x is zero. If I take y,</span> <span m="874000">negative x, I get a positive first component and zero for the</span> <span m="879000">second one. So, y, negative x would be a</span> <span m="882000">rotation at unit speed in the opposite direction.</span> <span m="886000">And there are a lot of tweaks you can do to it.</span> <span m="888000">If you flip the sides you will get rotation in the other</span> <span m="894000">direction. Yes?</span> <span m="899000">How do know that it is at unit angular velocity?</span> <span m="904000">Well, that is because if my angular velocity is one then</span> <span m="909000">that means the actually speed is equal to the distance from the</span> <span m="914000">origin. Because the arch length on a</span> <span m="917000">circle of a certain radius is equal to the radius times the</span> <span m="923000">angle. If the angle varies at rate one</span> <span m="925000">then I travel at speed equal to the radius.</span> <span m="928000">That is what I do here. The length of this vector is</span> <span m="932000">equal to the distance of the origin.</span> <span m="934000">I mean, it is not obvious on the picture.</span> <span m="937000">But, really, the vector that I put here is</span> <span m="939000">the same as this vector rotated so it has the same length.</span> <span m="943000">That is why the angular velocity is one.</span> <span m="946000">It doesn't really matter much anyway.</span> <span m="956000">What are we going to do with vector fields?</span> <span m="959000">Well, we are going to do a lot of things but let's start</span> <span m="968000">somewhere. One thing you might want to do</span> <span m="973000">with vector fields is I am going to think of now the situation</span> <span m="979000">where we have a force. If you have a force exerted on</span> <span m="984000">a particle and that particles moves on some trajectory then</span> <span m="988000">probably you have seen in physics that the work done by</span> <span m="993000">the force corresponds to the force dot product with the</span> <span m="997000">displacement vector, how much you have moved your</span> <span m="1001000">particle. And, of course,</span> <span m="1003000">if you do just a straight line trajectory or if the force is</span> <span m="1007000">constant that works well. But if you are moving on a</span> <span m="1011000">complicated trajectory and the force keeps changing then,</span> <span m="1016000">actually, you want to integrate that over time.</span> <span m="1021000">The first thing we will do is learn how to compute the work</span> <span m="1029000">done by a vector field, and mathematically that is</span> <span m="1036000">called a line integral. Physically, remember the work</span> <span m="1043000">done by a force is the force times the distance.</span> <span m="1048000">And, more precisely, it is actually the dot product</span> <span m="1053000">between the force as a vector and the displacement vector for</span> <span m="1059000">a small motion. Say that your point is moving</span> <span m="1064000">from here to here, you have the displacement delta</span> <span m="1068000">r. It is just the change in the</span> <span m="1070000">position vector. It is the vector from the old</span> <span m="1073000">position to the new position. And then you have your force</span> <span m="1077000">that is being exerted. And you do the dot product</span> <span m="1080000">between them. That will give you the work of</span> <span m="1083000">a force during this motion. And the physical significance</span> <span m="1088000">of this, well, the work tells you basically</span> <span m="1091000">how much energy you have to provide to actually perform this</span> <span m="1095000">motion. Just in case you haven't seen</span> <span m="1097000">this in 8.01 yet. I am hoping all of you have</span> <span m="1100000">heard about work somewhere, but in case it is completely</span> <span m="1105000">mysterious that is the amount of energy provided by the force.</span> <span m="1110000">If a force goes along the motion, it actually pushes the</span> <span m="1113000">particle. It provides an energy to do it</span> <span m="1116000">to do that motion. And, conversely,</span> <span m="1118000">if you are trying to go against the force then you have to</span> <span m="1122000">provide energy to the particle to be able to do that.</span> <span m="1126000">In particular, if this is the only force that</span> <span m="1129000">is taking place then the work would be the variation in</span> <span m="1134000">kinetic energy of a particle along the motion.</span> <span m="1138000">That is a good description for a small motion.</span> <span m="1140000">But let's say that my particle is not just doing that but it's</span> <span m="1144000">doing something complicated and my force keeps changing.</span> <span m="1149000">Somehow maybe I have a different force at every point.</span> <span m="1155000">Then I want to find the total work done along the motion.</span> <span m="1159000">Well, what I have to do is cut my trajectory into these little</span> <span m="1164000">pieces. And, for each of them,</span> <span m="1167000">I have a vector along the trajectory.</span> <span m="1170000">I have a force, I do the dot product and I sum</span> <span m="1174000">them together. And, of course,</span> <span m="1177000">to get the actual answer, I should actually cut into</span> <span m="1181000">smaller and smaller pieces and sum all of the small</span> <span m="1184000">contributions to work. So, in fact,</span> <span m="1189000">it is going to be an integral. Along some trajectory,</span> <span m="1199000">let's call C the trajectory for curve.</span> <span m="1204000">It is some curve. The work adds up to an integral.</span> <span m="1226000">We write this using the notation integral along C of F</span> <span m="1234000">dot dr. We have to decode this</span> <span m="1239000">notation. One way to decode this is to</span> <span m="1245000">say it is a limit as we cut into smaller and smaller pieces of</span> <span m="1254000">the sum over each piece of a trajectory of the force of a</span> <span m="1263000">given point dot product with that small vector along the</span> <span m="1271000">trajectory. Well, that is not how we will</span> <span m="1275000">compute it. To compute it,</span> <span m="1276000">we do things differently. How can we actually compute it?</span> <span m="1280000">Well, what we can do is say that actually we are cutting</span> <span m="1287000">things into small time intervals.</span> <span m="1292000">The way that we split the trajectory is we just take a</span> <span m="1296000">picture every, say, millisecond.</span> <span m="1298000">Every millisecond we have a new position.</span> <span m="1301000">And the motion, the amount by which you have</span> <span m="1306000">moved during each small time interval is basically the</span> <span m="1311000">velocity vector times the amount of time.</span> <span m="1316000">In fact, let me just rewrite this.</span> <span m="1321000">You do the dot product between the force and how much you have</span> <span m="1328000">moved, well, if I just rewrite it this</span> <span m="1331000">way, nothing has happened,</span> <span m="1333000">but what this thing is, actually,</span> <span m="1336000">is the velocity vector dr over dt.</span> <span m="1348000">What I am trying to say is that I can actually compute by</span> <span m="1356000">integral by integrating F dot product with dr / dt over time.</span> <span m="1364000">Whatever the initial time to whatever the final time is,</span> <span m="1371000">I integrate F dot product velocity dt.</span> <span m="1376000">And, of course, here this F,</span> <span m="1379000">I mean F at the point on the trajectory at time t.</span> <span m="1384000">This guy depends on x and y before it depends on t.</span> <span m="1391000">I see a lot of confused faces, so let's do an example.</span> <span m="1397000">Yes? Yes.</span> <span m="1403000">Here I need to put a limit as delta t to zero.</span> <span m="1410000">I cut my trajectory into smaller and smaller time</span> <span m="1412000">intervals. For each time interval,</span> <span m="1415000">I have a small motion which is, essentially,</span> <span m="1419000">velocity times delta t, and then I dot that with a</span> <span m="1423000">force and I sum them. Let's do an example.</span> <span m="1430000">Let's say that we want to find the work of this force.</span> <span m="1438000">I guess that was the first example we had.</span> <span m="1440000">It is a force field that tries to make everything rotate</span> <span m="1444000">somehow. Your first points along these</span> <span m="1448000">circles. And let's say that our</span> <span m="1451000">trajectory, our particle is moving along the parametric</span> <span m="1456000">curve. x = t, y = t^2 for t going from</span> <span m="1464000">zero to one. What that looks like -- Well,</span> <span m="1468000">maybe I should draw you a picture.</span> <span m="1471000">Our vector field. Our trajectory.</span> <span m="1483000">If you try to plot this, when you see y is actually x</span> <span m="1488000">squared, so it a piece of parabola that goes from the</span> <span m="1493000">origin to (1,1). That is what our curve looks</span> <span m="1498000">like. We are trying to get the work</span> <span m="1501000">done by our force along this trajectory.</span> <span m="1504000">I should point out; I mean if you are asking me how</span> <span m="1507000">did I get this? That is actually the wrong</span> <span m="1510000">question. This is all part of the data.</span> <span m="1513000">I have a force and I have a trajectory, and I want to find</span> <span m="1515000">what the work done is along that trajectory.</span> <span m="1517000">These two guys I can choose completely independently of each</span> <span m="1524000">other. The integral along C of F dot</span> <span m="1529000">dr will be -- Well, it is the integral from time</span> <span m="1534000">zero to time one of F dot the velocity vector dr over dt times</span> <span m="1541000">dt. That would be the integral from</span> <span m="1546000">zero to one. Let's try to figure it out.</span> <span m="1550000">What is F? F, at a point (x,</span> <span m="1558000">y), is &lt;- y, x&gt;.</span> <span m="1561000">But if I take the point where I am at time t then x is t and y</span> <span m="1566000">is t squared. Here I plug x equals t,</span> <span m="1569000">y equals t squared, and that will give me negative</span> <span m="1575000">t squared, t. Here I will put negative t</span> <span m="1579000">squared, t dot product. What is the velocity vector?</span> <span m="1584000">Well, dx over dt is just one, dy over dt is 2t.</span> <span m="1593000">So, the velocity vector is 1,2t dt.</span> <span m="1603000">Now we have to continue the calculation.</span> <span m="1607000">We get integral from zero to one of, what is this dot</span> <span m="1611000">product? Well, it is negative t squared</span> <span m="1614000">plus 2t squared. I get t squared.</span> <span m="1617000">Well, maybe I will write it. Negative t squared plus 2t</span> <span m="1621000">squared dt. That ends up being integral</span> <span m="1626000">from zero to one of t squared dt, which you all know how to</span> <span m="1632000">integrate and get one-third. That is the work done by the</span> <span m="1638000">force along this curve. Yes?</span> <span m="1643000">Well, I got it by just taking the dot product between the</span> <span m="1649000">force and the velocity. That is in case you are</span> <span m="1656000">wondering, things go like this. Any questions on how we did</span> <span m="1667000">this calculation? No.</span> <span m="1671000">Yes? Why can't you just do F dot dr?</span> <span m="1681000">Well, soon we will be able to. We don't know yet what dr means</span> <span m="1685000">or how to use it as a symbol because we haven't said yet,</span> <span m="1690000">I mean, see, this is a d vector r.</span> <span m="1694000">That is kind of strange thing to have.</span> <span m="1697000">And certainly r is not a usual variable.</span> <span m="1701000">We have to be careful about what are the rules,</span> <span m="1704000">what does this symbol mean? We are going to see that right</span> <span m="1708000">now. And then we can do it,</span> <span m="1710000">actually, in a slightly more efficient way.</span> <span m="1713000">I mean r is not a scalar quantity.</span> <span m="1715000">R is a position vector. You cannot integrate F with</span> <span m="1719000">respect to r. We don't know how to do that.</span> <span m="1727000">OK. Yes?</span> <span m="1750000">The question is if I took a different trajectory from the</span> <span m="1752000">origin to that point (1,1), what will happen?</span> <span m="1755000">Well, the answer is I would get something different.</span> <span m="1759000">For example, let me try to convince you of</span> <span m="1761000">that. For example,</span> <span m="1763000">say I chose to instead go like this and then around like that,</span> <span m="1771000">first I wouldn't do any work because here the force is</span> <span m="1775000">perpendicular to my motion. And then I would be going</span> <span m="1778000">against the force all the way around.</span> <span m="1780000">I should get something that is negative.</span> <span m="1782000">Even if you don't see that, just accept it at face value</span> <span m="1786000">that I say now. The value of a line integral,</span> <span m="1790000">in general, depends on how we got from point a to point b.</span> <span m="1794000">That is why we have to compute it by using the parametric</span> <span m="1797000">equation for the curve. It really depends on what curve</span> <span m="1800000">you choose.</span> <span m="1814000">Any other questions. Yes?</span> <span m="1822000">What happens when the force inflects the trajectory?</span> <span m="1825000">Well, then, actually, you would have to solve a</span> <span m="1828000">differential equation telling you how a particle moves to find</span> <span m="1831000">what the trajectory is. That is something that would be</span> <span m="1835000">a very useful topic. And that is probably more like</span> <span m="1839000">what you will do in 18.03, or maybe you actually know how</span> <span m="1842000">to do it in this case. What we are trying to develop</span> <span m="1845000">here is a method to figure out if we know what the trajectory</span> <span m="1849000">is what the work will be. It doesn't tell us what the</span> <span m="1852000">trajectory will be. But, of course,</span> <span m="1855000">we could also find that. But here, see,</span> <span m="1857000">I am not assuming, for example,</span> <span m="1859000">that the particle is moving just based on that force.</span> <span m="1862000">Maybe, actually, I am here to hold it in my hand</span> <span m="1864000">and force it to go where it is going,</span> <span m="1866000">or maybe there is some rail that is taking it in that</span> <span m="1870000">trajectory or whatever. I can really do it along any</span> <span m="1874000">trajectory. And, if I wanted to,</span> <span m="1876000">if I knew that was the case, I could try to find the</span> <span m="1878000">trajectory based on what the force is.</span> <span m="1880000">But that is not what we are doing here.</span> <span m="1896000">Let's try to make sense of what you asked just a few minutes</span> <span m="1901000">ago, what can we do directly with dr?</span> <span m="1905000">dr becomes somehow a vector. I mean, when I replace it by dr</span> <span m="1910000">over dt times dt, it becomes something that is a</span> <span m="1915000">vector with a dt next to it. In fact -- Well,</span> <span m="1921000">it is not really new. Let's see.</span> <span m="1927000">Another way to do it, let's say that our force has</span> <span m="1935000">components M and N. I claim that we can write</span> <span m="1941000">symbolically vector dr stands for its vector whose components</span> <span m="1947000">are dx, dy. It is a strange kind of vector.</span> <span m="1951000">I mean it is not a real vector, of course, but as a notion,</span> <span m="1958000">it is a pretty good notation because it tells us that F of dr</span> <span m="1965000">is M dx plus N dy. In fact, we will very often</span> <span m="1971000">write, instead of F dot dr line integral along c will be line</span> <span m="1978000">integral along c of M dx plus N dy.</span> <span m="1983000">And so, in this language, of course, what we are</span> <span m="1986000">integrating now, rather than a vector field,</span> <span m="1988000">becomes a differential. But you should think of it,</span> <span m="1991000">too, as being pretty much the same thing.</span> <span m="1992000">It is like when you compare the gradient of a function and its</span> <span m="1997000">differential, they are different notations</span> <span m="2000000">but have the same content. Now, there still remains the</span> <span m="2004000">question of how do we compute this kind of integral?</span> <span m="2007000">Because it is more subtle than the notation suggests.</span> <span m="2010000">Because M and N both depend on x and y.</span> <span m="2015000">And, if you just integrate it with respect to x,</span> <span m="2018000">you would be left with y's in there.</span> <span m="2020000">And you don't want to be left with y's.</span> <span m="2021000">You want a number at the end. See, the catch is along the</span> <span m="2026000">curve x and y are actually related to each other.</span> <span m="2031000">Whenever we write this, we have two variables x and y,</span> <span m="2034000">but, in fact, along the curve C we have only</span> <span m="2038000">one parameter. It could be x.</span> <span m="2040000">It could be y. It could be time.</span> <span m="2042000">Whatever you want. But we have to express</span> <span m="2044000">everything in terms of that one parameter.</span> <span m="2046000">And then we get a usual single variable integral.</span> <span m="2051000">How do we evaluate things in this language?</span> <span m="2057000">Well, we do it by substituting the parameter into everything.</span> <span m="2090000">The method to evaluate is to express x and y in terms of a</span> <span m="2106000">single variable. And then substitute that</span> <span m="2117000">variable. Let's, for example,</span> <span m="2120000">redo the one we had up there just using these new notations.</span> <span m="2125000">You will see that it is the same calculation but with</span> <span m="2131000">different notations. In that example that we had,</span> <span m="2140000">our vector field F was negative .</span> <span m="2152000">What we are integrating is negative y dx plus x dy.</span> <span m="2155000">And, see, if we have just this, we don't know how to integrate</span> <span m="2158000">that. I mean, well,</span> <span m="2159000">you could try to come up with negative x, y or something like</span> <span m="2161000">that. But that actually doesn't make</span> <span m="2163000">sense. It doesn't work.</span> <span m="2168000">What we will do is we will actually have to express</span> <span m="2173000">everything in terms of a same variable,</span> <span m="2178000">because it is a single integral and we should only have on</span> <span m="2181000">variable. And what that variable will be,</span> <span m="2185000">well, if we just do it the same way that would just be t.</span> <span m="2190000">How do we express everything in terms of t?</span> <span m="2194000">Well, we use the parametric equation.</span> <span m="2197000">We know that x is t and y is t squared.</span> <span m="2205000">We know what to do with these two guys.</span> <span m="2206000">What about dx and dy? Well, it is easy.</span> <span m="2209000">We just differentiate. dx becomes dt, dy becomes 2t dt.</span> <span m="2221000">I am just saying, in a different language,</span> <span m="2223000">what I said over here with dx over dt equals one,</span> <span m="2225000">dy over dt equals 2t. It is the same thing but</span> <span m="2229000">written slightly differently. Now, I am going to do it again.</span> <span m="2237000">I am going to switch from one board to the next one.</span> <span m="2240000">My integral becomes the integral over C of negative y is</span> <span m="2250000">minus t squared dt plus x is t times dy is 2t dt.</span> <span m="2259000">And now that I have only t left, it is fine to say I have a</span> <span m="2264000">usual single variable integral over a variable t that goes from</span> <span m="2269000">zero to one. Now I can say,</span> <span m="2271000">yes, this is the integral from zero to one of that stuff.</span> <span m="2275000">I can simply it a bit and it becomes t squared dt,</span> <span m="2280000">and I can compute it, equals one-third.</span> <span m="2284000">I have negative t squared and then I have plus 2t squared,</span> <span m="2288000">so end up with positive t squared.</span> <span m="2291000">It is the same as up there. Any questions?</span> <span m="2300000">Yes? dy is the differential of y,</span> <span m="2312000">y is t squared, so I get 2t dt.</span> <span m="2318000">I plug dt for dx, I plug 2t dt for dy and so on.</span> <span m="2326000">And that is the general method. If you are given a curve then</span> <span m="2331000">you first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms</span> <span m="2336000">of the same thing? And you get to choose,</span> <span m="2338000">in general, what parameter we use.</span> <span m="2340000">You choose to parameterize your curve in whatever way you want.</span> <span m="2354000">The note that I want to make is that this line integral depends</span> <span m="2368000">on the trajectory C but not on the parameterization.</span> <span m="2380000">You can choose whichever variable you want.</span> <span m="2383000">For example, what you could do is when you</span> <span m="2389000">know that you have that trajectory,</span> <span m="2392000">you could also choose to parameterize it as x equals,</span> <span m="2396000">I don't know, sine theta, y equals sine square theta,</span> <span m="2403000">because y is x squared where theta goes from zero to pi over</span> <span m="2409000">two. And then you could get dx and</span> <span m="2411000">dy in terms of d theta. And you would be able to do it</span> <span m="2415000">with a lot of trig and you would get the same answer.</span> <span m="2419000">That would be a harder way to get the same thing.</span> <span m="2422000">What you should do in practice is use the most reasonable way</span> <span m="2427000">to parameterize your curve. If you know that you have a</span> <span m="2431000">piece of parabola y equals x squared, there is no way you</span> <span m="2435000">would put sine and sine squared. You could set x equals,</span> <span m="2438000">y equals t squared, which is very reasonable.</span> <span m="2440000">You could even take a small shortcut and say that your</span> <span m="2443000">variable will be just x. That means x you just keep as</span> <span m="2447000">it is. And then, when you have y,</span> <span m="2450000">you set y equals x squared, dy equals 2x dx,</span> <span m="2453000">and then you will have an integral over x.</span> <span m="2456000">That works. So, this one is not practical.</span> <span m="2469000">But you get to choose.</span> <span m="2505000">Now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry.</span> <span m="2512000">We have said here is how we compute it in general,</span> <span m="2515000">and that is the general method for computing a line integral</span> <span m="2519000">for work. You can always do this,</span> <span m="2520000">try to find a parameter, the simplest one,</span> <span m="2524000">express everything in terms of its variable and then you have</span> <span m="2527000">an integral to compute. But sometimes you can actually</span> <span m="2531000">save a lot of work by just thinking geometrically about</span> <span m="2534000">what this all does. Let me tell you about the</span> <span m="2541000">geometric approach. One thing I want to remind you</span> <span m="2549000">of first is what is this vector dr?</span> <span m="2554000">Well, what is vector delta r? If I take a very small piece of</span> <span m="2561000">the trajectory then my vector delta r will be tangent to the</span> <span m="2567000">trajectory. It will be going in the same</span> <span m="2570000">direction as the unit tangent vector t.</span> <span m="2573000">And what is its length? Well, its length is the arc</span> <span m="2578000">length along the trajectory, which we called delta s.</span> <span m="2582000">Remember, s was the distance along the trajectory.</span> <span m="2589000">We can write vector dr equals dx, dy, but that is also T times</span> <span m="2601000">ds. It is a vector whose direction</span> <span m="2604000">is tangent to the curve and whose length element is actually</span> <span m="2609000">the arc length element. I mean, if you don't like this</span> <span m="2615000">notation, think about dividing everything by dt.</span> <span m="2621000">Then what we are saying is dr over dt, which is the velocity</span> <span m="2625000">vector. Well, in coordinates,</span> <span m="2627000">the velocity vector is dx over dt, dy over dt.</span> <span m="2631000">But, more geometrically, the direction of a velocity</span> <span m="2637000">vector is tangent to the trajectory and its magnitude is</span> <span m="2643000">speed ds over dt. So, that is really the same</span> <span m="2650000">thing. If I say this,</span> <span m="2654000">that means that my line integral F to dr,</span> <span m="2660000">well, I say I can write it as integral of M dx plus N dy.</span> <span m="2668000">That is what I will do if I want to compute it by computing</span> <span m="2672000">the integral. But, if instead I want to think</span> <span m="2676000">about it geometrically, I could rewrite it as F dot T</span> <span m="2682000">ds. Now you can think of this,</span> <span m="2685000">F dot T is a scalar quantity. It is the tangent component of</span> <span m="2690000">my force. I take my force and project it</span> <span m="2693000">to the tangent direction to a trajectory and the I integrate</span> <span m="2698000">that along the curve. They are the same thing.</span> <span m="2704000">And sometimes it is easier to do it this way.</span> <span m="2707000">Here is an example. This is bound to be easier only</span> <span m="2715000">when the field and the curve are relatively simple and have a</span> <span m="2718000">geometric relation to each other.</span> <span m="2720000">If I give you an evil formula with x cubed plus y to the fifth</span> <span m="2724000">or whatever there is very little chance that you will be able to</span> <span m="2728000">simplify it that way. But let's say that my</span> <span m="2732000">trajectory is just a circle of radius a centered at the origin.</span> <span m="2742000">Let's say I am doing that counterclockwise and let's say</span> <span m="2752000">that my vector field is xi yj. What does that look like?</span> <span m="2760000">Well, my trajectory is just this circle.</span> <span m="2767000">My vector field, remember, xi plus yj,</span> <span m="2771000">that is the one that is pointing radially from the</span> <span m="2775000">origin. Hopefully, if you have good</span> <span m="2778000">physics intuition here, you will already know what the</span> <span m="2780000">work is going to be. It is going to be zero because</span> <span m="2786000">the force is perpendicular to the motion.</span> <span m="2794000">Now we can say it directly by saying if you have any point of</span> <span m="2801000">a circle then the tangent vector to the circle will be,</span> <span m="2809000">well, it's tangent to the circle,</span> <span m="2811000">so that means it is perpendicular to the radial</span> <span m="2814000">direction, while the force is pointing in</span> <span m="2820000">the radial direction so you have a right angle between them.</span> <span m="2829000">F is perpendicular to T. F dot T is zero.</span> <span m="2836000">The line integral of F dot T ds is just zero.</span> <span m="2842000">That is much easier than writing this is integral of x</span> <span m="2846000">over dx plus y over dy. What do we do?</span> <span m="2849000">Well, we set x equals a cosine theta, y equals a sine theta.</span> <span m="2853000">We get a bunch of trig things. It cancels out to zero.</span> <span m="2857000">It is not much harder but we saved time by not even thinking</span> <span m="2862000">about how to parameterize things.</span> <span m="2865000">Let's just do a last one. That was the first one.</span> <span m="2870000">Let's say now that I take the same curve C,</span> <span m="2875000">but now my vector field is the one that rotates negative yi</span> <span m="2883000">plus xj. That means along my circle the</span> <span m="2891000">tangent vector goes like this and my vector field is also</span> <span m="2903000">going around. So, in fact,</span> <span m="2908000">at this point the vector field will always be going in the same</span> <span m="2914000">direction. Now F is actually parallel to</span> <span m="2921000">the tangent direction. That means that the dot product</span> <span m="2927000">of F dot T, remember, if it is the component of F in</span> <span m="2932000">this direction that will be the same of the length of F.</span> <span m="2937000">But what is the length of F on this circle if this length is a?</span> <span m="2942000">It is just going to be a. That is what we said earlier</span> <span m="2945000">about this vector field. At every point,</span> <span m="2948000">this dot product is a. Now we know how to integrate</span> <span m="2951000">that quite quickly.</span> <span m="2965000">Because it becomes the integral of a ds, but a is a constant so</span> <span m="2970000">we can take it out. And now what do we get when we</span> <span m="2974000">integrate ds along C? Well, we should get the total</span> <span m="2978000">length of the curve if we sum all the little pieces of arc</span> <span m="2983000">length. But we know that the length of</span> <span m="2987000">a circle of radius a is 2pi a, so we get 2(pi)a squared.</span> <span m="2992000">If we were to compute that by hand, well, what would we do?</span> <span m="3001000">We would be computing integral of minus y dx plus x dy.</span> <span m="3008000">Since we are on a circle, we will probably set x equals a</span> <span m="3013000">times cosine theta, y equals a times sine theta for</span> <span m="3016000">theta between zero and 2pi. Then we would get dx and dy out</span> <span m="3023000">of these. So, y is a sine theta,</span> <span m="3027000">dx is negative a sine theta d theta, if you differentiate a</span> <span m="3033000">cosine, plus a cosine theta times a cosine theta d theta.</span> <span m="3040000">Well, you will just end up with integral from zero to 2pi of a</span> <span m="3045000">squared time sine squared theta plus cosine square theta times d</span> <span m="3051000">theta. That becomes just one.</span> <span m="3053000">And you get the same answer. It took about the same amount</span> <span m="3056000">of time because I did this one rushing very quickly,</span> <span m="3059000">but normally it takes about at least twice the amount of time</span> <span m="3063000">to do it with a calculation. That tells you sometimes it is</span> <span m="3066000">worth thinking geometrically.</span> </p>

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
OK.
Today we have a new topic,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and we are going to start to
learn about vector fields and

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
line integrals.
Last week we had been doing

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
double integrals.
For today we just forget all of

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that, but don't actually forget
it.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Put it away in a corner of your
mind.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is going to come back next
week, but what we do today will

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
include line integrals.
And these are completely

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
different things,
so it helps,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
actually, if you don't think of
double integrals at all while

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
doing line integrals.
Anyway, let's start with vector

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
fields.
What is a vector field?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, a vector field is
something that is of a form,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
while it is a vector,
but while M and N,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the components,
actually depend on x and y,on

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the point where you are.
So, they are functions of x and

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
y.
What that means,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
concretely, is that every point
in the plane you have a vector.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In a corn field,
every where you have corn.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In a vector field,
everywhere you have a vector.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That is how it works.
A good example of a vector

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
field, I don't know if you have
seen these maps that show the

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
wind, but here are some cool
images done by NASA.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Actually, that is a picture of
wind patterns off the coast of

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
California with Santa Ana winds,
in case you are wondering what

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
has been going on recently.
You have all of these vectors

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that show you the velocity of
the air basically at every

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
point.
I mean, of course you don't

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
draw it every point,
because if you drew a vector at

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
absolutely all the points of a
plane then you would just fill

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
up everything and you wouldn't
see anything.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, choose points and draw the
vectors at those points.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Here is another cool image,
which is upside down.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That is a hurricane off the
coast of Mexico with the winds

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
spiraling around the hurricane.
Anyway, it is kind of hard to

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
see.
You don't really see all the

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
vectors, actually,
because the autofocus is having

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
trouble with it.
It cannot really do it,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
so I guess I will go back to
the previous one.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Anyway, a vector field is
something where at each point --

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:50,000
-- in the plane we have vector F
that depends on x and y.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This occurs in real life when
you look at velocity fields in a

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
fluid.
For example, the wind.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That is what these pictures
show.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
At every point you have a
velocity of a fluid that is

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
moving.
Another example is force fields.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, force fields are not
something out of Star Wars.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you look at gravitational
attraction,

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you know that if you have a
mass somewhere,

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
well, it will be attracted to
fall down because of the gravity

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
field of the earth,
which means that at every point

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you have a vector that is
pointing down.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And, the same thing in space,
you have the gravitational

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
field of planets,
stars and so on.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That is also an example of a
vector field because,

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
wherever you go,
you would have that vector.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And what it is depends on where
you are.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The examples from the real
world are things like velocity

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in a fluid or force field where
you have a force that depends on

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the point where you are.
We are going to try to study

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
vector fields mathematically.
We won't really care what they

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
are most of the time,
but, as we will explore with

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
them defined quantities and so
on,

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we will very often use these
motivations to justify why we

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
would care about certain
quantities.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The first thing we have to
figure out is how do we draw a

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
vector field,
you know, how do you generate a

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
plot like that?
Let's practice drawing a few

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
vector fields.
Well, let's say our very first

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
vector field will be just 2i j.
It is kind of a silly vector

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
field because it doesn't
actually depend on x and y.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That means it is the same
vector everywhere.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I take a plane and take vector
.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I guess it points in that
direction.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It is two units to the right
and one up.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I just put that vector
everywhere.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You just put it at a few points
all over the place.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And when you think you have
enough so that you understand

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
what is going on then you stop.
Here probably we don't need

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that many.
I mean here I think we get the

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
picture.
Everywhere we have a vector

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
.
Now, let's try to look at

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
slightly more interesting
examples.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's say I give you a vector
field x times i hat.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There is no j component.
How would you draw that?

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, first of all,
we know that this guy is only

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
in the i direction so it is
always horizontal.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It doesn't have a j component.
Everywhere it would be a

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
horizontal vector.
Now, the question is how long

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is it?
Well, how long it is depends on

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
x.
For example,

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
if x is zero then this will
actually be the zero vector.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
x is zero here on the y-axis.
I will take a different color.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If I am on the y-axis,
I actually have the zero

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
vector.
Now, if x becomes positive

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
small then I will have actually
a small positive multiple of i

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
so I will be going a little bit
to the right.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then, if I increase x,
this guy becomes larger so I

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
get a longer vector to the
right.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If x is negative then my vector
field points to the left

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
instead.
It looks something like that.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Any questions about that
picture?

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No.
OK.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Usually, we are not going to
try to have very accurate,

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you know, we won't actually
take time to plot a vector field

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
very carefully.
I mean, if we need to,

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
computers can do it for us.
It is useful to have an idea of

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
what a vector field does
roughly.

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Whether it is getting larger
and larger, in what direction it

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
is pointing, what are the
general features?

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Just to do a couple of more,
actually, you will see very

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
quickly that the examples I use
in lecture are pretty much

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
always the same ones.
We will be playing a lot with

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
these particular vector fields
just because they are good

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
examples.
Let's say I give you xi yj.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That one has an interesting
geometric significance.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If I take a point (x,
y), there I want to take a

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
vector x, y.
How do I do that?

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, it is the same as a
vector from the origin to this

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
point.
I take this vector and I copy

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it so that it starts at one
point.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It looks like that.
And the same thing at every

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
point.
It is a vector field that is

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
pointing radially away from the
origin, and its magnitude

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
increases with distance from the
origin.

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You don't have to draw as many
as me, but the idea is this

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
vector field everywhere points
away from the origin.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And its magnitude is equal to
the distance from the origin.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If these were,
for example,

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
velocity fields,
well, you would see visually

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
what is happening to your fluid.
Like here maybe you have a

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
source at the origin that is
pouring fluid out and it is

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
flowing all the way away from
that.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's do just a last one.
Let's say I give you minus y, x.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What does that look like?
That is an interesting one,

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
actually.
Let's say that I have a point

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
(x, y) here.
This vector here is <x,

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
y>.
But the vector I want is <-

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
y, x>.
What does that look like?

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It is perpendicular to the
position to this vector.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If I rotate this vector,
let me maybe draw a picture on

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the side, and take vector x,
y.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
A vector with components
negative y and x is going to be

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
like this.
It is the vector that I get by

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
rotating by 90 degrees
counterclockwise.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And, of course,
I do not want to put that

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
vector at the origin.
I want to put it at the point

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
x, y.
In fact, what I will draw is

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
something like this.
And similarly here like that,

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
like that, etc.
And if I am closer to the

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
origin then it looks a bit the
same, but it is shorter.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And at the origin it is zero.
And when I am further away it

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
becomes even larger.
See, this vector field,

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
if it was the motion of a
fluid,

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
it would correspond to a fluid
that is just going around the

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
origin in circles rotating at
uniform speed.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is actually the velocity
field for uniform rotation.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And, if you figure out how long
it takes for a particle of fluid

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to go all the way around,
that would be actually 2(pi)

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
because the length of a circle
is 2(pi) times the radius.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That is actually at unit
angular velocity,

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
one radiant per second or per
unit time.

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That is why this guy comes up
quite a lot in real life.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And you can imagine lots of
variations on these.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Of course, you can also imagine
vector fields given by much more

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
complicated formulas,
and then you would have a hard

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
time drawing them.
Maybe you will use a computer

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
or maybe you will just give up
and just do whatever calculation

175
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
you have to do without trying to
visualize the vector field.

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But if you have a nice simple
one then it is worth doing it

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
because sometimes it will give
you insight about what you are

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
going to compute next.
Any questions first about these

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
pictures?
No.

180
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
OK.
Oh, yes?

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are asking if it should be
y, negative x.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I think it would be the other
way around.

183
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
See, for example,
if I am at this point then y is

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
positive and x is zero.
If I take y,

185
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
negative x, I get a positive
first component and zero for the

186
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
second one.
So, y, negative x would be a

187
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
rotation at unit speed in the
opposite direction.

188
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And there are a lot of tweaks
you can do to it.

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If you flip the sides you will
get rotation in the other

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
direction.
Yes?

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How do know that it is at unit
angular velocity?

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, that is because if my
angular velocity is one then

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that means the actually speed is
equal to the distance from the

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
origin.
Because the arch length on a

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
circle of a certain radius is
equal to the radius times the

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
angle.
If the angle varies at rate one

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
then I travel at speed equal to
the radius.

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That is what I do here.
The length of this vector is

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
equal to the distance of the
origin.

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, it is not obvious on
the picture.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But, really,
the vector that I put here is

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the same as this vector rotated
so it has the same length.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is why the angular
velocity is one.

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It doesn't really matter much
anyway.

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What are we going to do with
vector fields?

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, we are going to do a lot
of things but let's start

207
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
somewhere.
One thing you might want to do

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
with vector fields is I am going
to think of now the situation

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
where we have a force.
If you have a force exerted on

210
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
a particle and that particles
moves on some trajectory then

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
probably you have seen in
physics that the work done by

212
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the force corresponds to the
force dot product with the

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
displacement vector,
how much you have moved your

214
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
particle.
And, of course,

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
if you do just a straight line
trajectory or if the force is

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
constant that works well.
But if you are moving on a

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
complicated trajectory and the
force keeps changing then,

218
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
actually, you want to integrate
that over time.

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The first thing we will do is
learn how to compute the work

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
done by a vector field,
and mathematically that is

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
called a line integral.
Physically, remember the work

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
done by a force is the force
times the distance.

223
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And, more precisely,
it is actually the dot product

224
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
between the force as a vector
and the displacement vector for

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
a small motion.
Say that your point is moving

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
from here to here,
you have the displacement delta

227
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
r.
It is just the change in the

228
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
position vector.
It is the vector from the old

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
position to the new position.
And then you have your force

230
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that is being exerted.
And you do the dot product

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
between them.
That will give you the work of

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
a force during this motion.
And the physical significance

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
of this, well,
the work tells you basically

234
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
how much energy you have to
provide to actually perform this

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
motion.
Just in case you haven't seen

236
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
this in 8.01 yet.
I am hoping all of you have

237
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
heard about work somewhere,
but in case it is completely

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
mysterious that is the amount of
energy provided by the force.

239
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If a force goes along the
motion, it actually pushes the

240
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
particle.
It provides an energy to do it

241
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to do that motion.
And, conversely,

242
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
if you are trying to go against
the force then you have to

243
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
provide energy to the particle
to be able to do that.

244
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In particular,
if this is the only force that

245
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
is taking place then the work
would be the variation in

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
kinetic energy of a particle
along the motion.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That is a good description for
a small motion.

248
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But let's say that my particle
is not just doing that but it's

249
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
doing something complicated and
my force keeps changing.

250
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Somehow maybe I have a
different force at every point.

251
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then I want to find the total
work done along the motion.

252
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Well, what I have to do is cut
my trajectory into these little

253
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
pieces.
And, for each of them,

254
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I have a vector along the
trajectory.

255
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I have a force,
I do the dot product and I sum

256
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
them together.
And, of course,

257
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
to get the actual answer,
I should actually cut into

258
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
smaller and smaller pieces and
sum all of the small

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
contributions to work.
So, in fact,

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it is going to be an integral.
Along some trajectory,

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
let's call C the trajectory for
curve.

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It is some curve.
The work adds up to an integral.

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We write this using the
notation integral along C of F

264
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
dot dr.
We have to decode this

265
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
notation.
One way to decode this is to

266
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
say it is a limit as we cut into
smaller and smaller pieces of

267
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
the sum over each piece of a
trajectory of the force of a

268
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
given point dot product with
that small vector along the

269
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
trajectory.
Well, that is not how we will

270
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
compute it.
To compute it,

271
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we do things differently.
How can we actually compute it?

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, what we can do is say
that actually we are cutting

273
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
things into small time
intervals.

274
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The way that we split the
trajectory is we just take a

275
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
picture every,
say, millisecond.

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Every millisecond we have a new
position.

277
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And the motion,
the amount by which you have

278
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
moved during each small time
interval is basically the

279
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
velocity vector times the amount
of time.

280
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In fact, let me just rewrite
this.

281
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You do the dot product between
the force and how much you have

282
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
moved,
well, if I just rewrite it this

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
way,
nothing has happened,

284
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
but what this thing is,
actually,

285
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is the velocity vector dr over
dt.

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What I am trying to say is that
I can actually compute by

287
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
integral by integrating F dot
product with dr / dt over time.

288
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Whatever the initial time to
whatever the final time is,

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I integrate F dot product
velocity dt.

290
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And, of course,
here this F,

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I mean F at the point on the
trajectory at time t.

292
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This guy depends on x and y
before it depends on t.

293
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I see a lot of confused faces,
so let's do an example.

294
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes?
Yes.

295
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Here I need to put a limit as
delta t to zero.

296
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I cut my trajectory into
smaller and smaller time

297
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
intervals.
For each time interval,

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I have a small motion which is,
essentially,

299
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
velocity times delta t,
and then I dot that with a

300
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
force and I sum them.
Let's do an example.

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Let's say that we want to find
the work of this force.

302
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I guess that was the first
example we had.

303
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It is a force field that tries
to make everything rotate

304
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
somehow.
Your first points along these

305
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
circles.
And let's say that our

306
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
trajectory, our particle is
moving along the parametric

307
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
curve.
x = t, y = t^2 for t going from

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
zero to one.
What that looks like -- Well,

309
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
maybe I should draw you a
picture.

310
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Our vector field.
Our trajectory.

311
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If you try to plot this,
when you see y is actually x

312
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
squared, so it a piece of
parabola that goes from the

313
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
origin to (1,1).
That is what our curve looks

314
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
like.
We are trying to get the work

315
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
done by our force along this
trajectory.

316
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I should point out;
I mean if you are asking me how

317
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
did I get this?
That is actually the wrong

318
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
question.
This is all part of the data.

319
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I have a force and I have a
trajectory, and I want to find

320
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
what the work done is along that
trajectory.

321
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
These two guys I can choose
completely independently of each

322
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
other.
The integral along C of F dot

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
dr will be -- Well,
it is the integral from time

324
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
zero to time one of F dot the
velocity vector dr over dt times

325
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
dt.
That would be the integral from

326
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
zero to one.
Let's try to figure it out.

327
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is F?
F, at a point (x,

328
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
y), is <- y,
x>.

329
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But if I take the point where I
am at time t then x is t and y

330
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
is t squared.
Here I plug x equals t,

331
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
y equals t squared,
and that will give me negative

332
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
t squared, t.
Here I will put negative t

333
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
squared, t dot product.
What is the velocity vector?

334
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Well, dx over dt is just one,
dy over dt is 2t.

335
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So, the velocity vector is 1,2t
dt.

336
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Now we have to continue the
calculation.

337
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We get integral from zero to
one of, what is this dot

338
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
product?
Well, it is negative t squared

339
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
plus 2t squared.
I get t squared.

340
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well, maybe I will write it.
Negative t squared plus 2t

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
squared dt.
That ends up being integral

342
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
from zero to one of t squared
dt, which you all know how to

343
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
integrate and get one-third.
That is the work done by the

344
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
force along this curve.
Yes?

345
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, I got it by just taking
the dot product between the

346
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
force and the velocity.
That is in case you are

347
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:47,000
wondering, things go like this.
Any questions on how we did

348
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
this calculation?
No.

349
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes?
Why can't you just do F dot dr?

350
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, soon we will be able to.
We don't know yet what dr means

351
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
or how to use it as a symbol
because we haven't said yet,

352
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I mean, see,
this is a d vector r.

353
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That is kind of strange thing
to have.

354
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And certainly r is not a usual
variable.

355
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We have to be careful about
what are the rules,

356
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
what does this symbol mean?
We are going to see that right

357
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
now.
And then we can do it,

358
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
actually, in a slightly more
efficient way.

359
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I mean r is not a scalar
quantity.

360
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
R is a position vector.
You cannot integrate F with

361
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
respect to r.
We don't know how to do that.

362
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
OK.
Yes?

363
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The question is if I took a
different trajectory from the

364
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
origin to that point (1,1),
what will happen?

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Well, the answer is I would get
something different.

366
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
For example,
let me try to convince you of

367
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that.
For example,

368
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
say I chose to instead go like
this and then around like that,

369
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
first I wouldn't do any work
because here the force is

370
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
perpendicular to my motion.
And then I would be going

371
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
against the force all the way
around.

372
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I should get something that is
negative.

373
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Even if you don't see that,
just accept it at face value

374
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
that I say now.
The value of a line integral,

375
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
in general, depends on how we
got from point a to point b.

376
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That is why we have to compute
it by using the parametric

377
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
equation for the curve.
It really depends on what curve

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you choose.

379
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Any other questions.
Yes?

380
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What happens when the force
inflects the trajectory?

381
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Well, then, actually,
you would have to solve a

382
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
differential equation telling
you how a particle moves to find

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
what the trajectory is.
That is something that would be

384
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a very useful topic.
And that is probably more like

385
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
what you will do in 18.03,
or maybe you actually know how

386
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to do it in this case.
What we are trying to develop

387
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
here is a method to figure out
if we know what the trajectory

388
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is what the work will be.
It doesn't tell us what the

389
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
trajectory will be.
But, of course,

390
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
we could also find that.
But here, see,

391
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I am not assuming,
for example,

392
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that the particle is moving
just based on that force.

393
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe, actually,
I am here to hold it in my hand

394
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and force it to go where it is
going,

395
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
or maybe there is some rail
that is taking it in that

396
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
trajectory or whatever.
I can really do it along any

397
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
trajectory.
And, if I wanted to,

398
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
if I knew that was the case,
I could try to find the

399
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
trajectory based on what the
force is.

400
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But that is not what we are
doing here.

401
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's try to make sense of what
you asked just a few minutes

402
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
ago, what can we do directly
with dr?

403
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
dr becomes somehow a vector.
I mean, when I replace it by dr

404
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
over dt times dt,
it becomes something that is a

405
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
vector with a dt next to it.
In fact -- Well,

406
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it is not really new.
Let's see.

407
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Another way to do it,
let's say that our force has

408
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
components M and N.
I claim that we can write

409
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
symbolically vector dr stands
for its vector whose components

410
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
are dx, dy.
It is a strange kind of vector.

411
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean it is not a real vector,
of course, but as a notion,

412
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
it is a pretty good notation
because it tells us that F of dr

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
is M dx plus N dy.
In fact, we will very often

414
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
write, instead of F dot dr line
integral along c will be line

415
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
integral along c of M dx plus N
dy.

416
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And so, in this language,
of course, what we are

417
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
integrating now,
rather than a vector field,

418
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
becomes a differential.
But you should think of it,

419
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
too, as being pretty much the
same thing.

420
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It is like when you compare the
gradient of a function and its

421
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
differential,
they are different notations

422
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but have the same content.
Now, there still remains the

423
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
question of how do we compute
this kind of integral?

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because it is more subtle than
the notation suggests.

425
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Because M and N both depend on
x and y.

426
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And, if you just integrate it
with respect to x,

427
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you would be left with y's in
there.

428
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And you don't want to be left
with y's.

429
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You want a number at the end.
See, the catch is along the

430
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
curve x and y are actually
related to each other.

431
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Whenever we write this,
we have two variables x and y,

432
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
but, in fact,
along the curve C we have only

433
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
one parameter.
It could be x.

434
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It could be y.
It could be time.

435
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Whatever you want.
But we have to express

436
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
everything in terms of that one
parameter.

437
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And then we get a usual single
variable integral.

438
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
How do we evaluate things in
this language?

439
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Well, we do it by substituting
the parameter into everything.

440
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The method to evaluate is to
express x and y in terms of a

441
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:17,000
single variable.
And then substitute that

442
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
variable.
Let's, for example,

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
redo the one we had up there
just using these new notations.

444
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You will see that it is the
same calculation but with

445
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:40,000
different notations.
In that example that we had,

446
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:52,000
our vector field F was negative
.

447
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What we are integrating is
negative y dx plus x dy.

448
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And, see, if we have just this,
we don't know how to integrate

449
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that.
I mean, well,

450
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
you could try to come up with
negative x, y or something like

451
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that.
But that actually doesn't make

452
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
sense.
It doesn't work.

453
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What we will do is we will
actually have to express

454
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
everything in terms of a same
variable,

455
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because it is a single integral
and we should only have on

456
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
variable.
And what that variable will be,

457
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
well, if we just do it the same
way that would just be t.

458
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
How do we express everything in
terms of t?

459
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, we use the parametric
equation.

460
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We know that x is t and y is t
squared.

461
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We know what to do with these
two guys.

462
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What about dx and dy?
Well, it is easy.

463
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We just differentiate.
dx becomes dt, dy becomes 2t dt.

464
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I am just saying,
in a different language,

465
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
what I said over here with dx
over dt equals one,

466
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
dy over dt equals 2t.
It is the same thing but

467
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:17,000
written slightly differently.
Now, I am going to do it again.

468
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I am going to switch from one
board to the next one.

469
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
My integral becomes the
integral over C of negative y is

470
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:39,000
minus t squared dt plus x is t
times dy is 2t dt.

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And now that I have only t
left, it is fine to say I have a

472
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
usual single variable integral
over a variable t that goes from

473
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
zero to one.
Now I can say,

474
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
yes, this is the integral from
zero to one of that stuff.

475
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I can simply it a bit and it
becomes t squared dt,

476
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and I can compute it,
equals one-third.

477
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I have negative t squared and
then I have plus 2t squared,

478
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
so end up with positive t
squared.

479
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It is the same as up there.
Any questions?

480
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes?
dy is the differential of y,

481
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
y is t squared,
so I get 2t dt.

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I plug dt for dx,
I plug 2t dt for dy and so on.

483
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And that is the general method.
If you are given a curve then

484
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
you first have to figure out how
do you express x and y in terms

485
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
of the same thing?
And you get to choose,

486
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
in general, what parameter we
use.

487
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You choose to parameterize your
curve in whatever way you want.

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The note that I want to make is
that this line integral depends

489
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:40,000
on the trajectory C but not on
the parameterization.

490
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You can choose whichever
variable you want.

491
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
For example,
what you could do is when you

492
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
know that you have that
trajectory,

493
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
you could also choose to
parameterize it as x equals,

494
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't know, sine theta,
y equals sine square theta,

495
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
because y is x squared where
theta goes from zero to pi over

496
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
two.
And then you could get dx and

497
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
dy in terms of d theta.
And you would be able to do it

498
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with a lot of trig and you would
get the same answer.

499
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That would be a harder way to
get the same thing.

500
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What you should do in practice
is use the most reasonable way

501
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
to parameterize your curve.
If you know that you have a

502
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
piece of parabola y equals x
squared, there is no way you

503
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
would put sine and sine squared.
You could set x equals,

504
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
y equals t squared,
which is very reasonable.

505
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You could even take a small
shortcut and say that your

506
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
variable will be just x.
That means x you just keep as

507
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
it is.
And then, when you have y,

508
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you set y equals x squared,
dy equals 2x dx,

509
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and then you will have an
integral over x.

510
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That works.
So, this one is not practical.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But you get to choose.

512
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Now let me tell you a bit more
about the geometry.

513
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We have said here is how we
compute it in general,

514
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and that is the general method
for computing a line integral

515
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
for work.
You can always do this,

516
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
try to find a parameter,
the simplest one,

517
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
express everything in terms of
its variable and then you have

518
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
an integral to compute.
But sometimes you can actually

519
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
save a lot of work by just
thinking geometrically about

520
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
what this all does.
Let me tell you about the

521
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
geometric approach.
One thing I want to remind you

522
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
of first is what is this vector
dr?

523
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well, what is vector delta r?
If I take a very small piece of

524
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the trajectory then my vector
delta r will be tangent to the

525
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
trajectory.
It will be going in the same

526
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
direction as the unit tangent
vector t.

527
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And what is its length?
Well, its length is the arc

528
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
length along the trajectory,
which we called delta s.

529
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Remember, s was the distance
along the trajectory.

530
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We can write vector dr equals
dx, dy, but that is also T times

531
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ds.
It is a vector whose direction

532
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
is tangent to the curve and
whose length element is actually

533
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the arc length element.
I mean, if you don't like this

534
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
notation, think about dividing
everything by dt.

535
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Then what we are saying is dr
over dt, which is the velocity

536
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
vector.
Well, in coordinates,

537
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
the velocity vector is dx over
dt, dy over dt.

538
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But, more geometrically,
the direction of a velocity

539
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
vector is tangent to the
trajectory and its magnitude is

540
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
speed ds over dt.
So, that is really the same

541
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
thing.
If I say this,

542
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that means that my line
integral F to dr,

543
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:28,000
well, I say I can write it as
integral of M dx plus N dy.

544
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That is what I will do if I
want to compute it by computing

545
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
the integral.
But, if instead I want to think

546
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
about it geometrically,
I could rewrite it as F dot T

547
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
ds.
Now you can think of this,

548
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
F dot T is a scalar quantity.
It is the tangent component of

549
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
my force.
I take my force and project it

550
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
to the tangent direction to a
trajectory and the I integrate

551
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
that along the curve.
They are the same thing.

552
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And sometimes it is easier to
do it this way.

553
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Here is an example.
This is bound to be easier only

554
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
when the field and the curve are
relatively simple and have a

555
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
geometric relation to each
other.

556
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If I give you an evil formula
with x cubed plus y to the fifth

557
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
or whatever there is very little
chance that you will be able to

558
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
simplify it that way.
But let's say that my

559
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
trajectory is just a circle of
radius a centered at the origin.

560
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's say I am doing that
counterclockwise and let's say

561
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
that my vector field is xi yj.
What does that look like?

562
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, my trajectory is just
this circle.

563
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
My vector field,
remember, xi plus yj,

564
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that is the one that is
pointing radially from the

565
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
origin.
Hopefully, if you have good

566
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
physics intuition here,
you will already know what the

567
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
work is going to be.
It is going to be zero because

568
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:34,000
the force is perpendicular to
the motion.

569
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Now we can say it directly by
saying if you have any point of

570
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
a circle then the tangent vector
to the circle will be,

571
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
well, it's tangent to the
circle,

572
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
so that means it is
perpendicular to the radial

573
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
direction,
while the force is pointing in

574
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:09,000
the radial direction so you have
a right angle between them.

575
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
F is perpendicular to T.
F dot T is zero.

576
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The line integral of F dot T ds
is just zero.

577
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That is much easier than
writing this is integral of x

578
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
over dx plus y over dy.
What do we do?

579
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, we set x equals a cosine
theta, y equals a sine theta.

580
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We get a bunch of trig things.
It cancels out to zero.

581
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It is not much harder but we
saved time by not even thinking

582
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
about how to parameterize
things.

583
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Let's just do a last one.
That was the first one.

584
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Let's say now that I take the
same curve C,

585
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
but now my vector field is the
one that rotates negative yi

586
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
plus xj.
That means along my circle the

587
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:23,000
tangent vector goes like this
and my vector field is also

588
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
going around.
So, in fact,

589
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
at this point the vector field
will always be going in the same

590
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
direction.
Now F is actually parallel to

591
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
the tangent direction.
That means that the dot product

592
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
of F dot T, remember,
if it is the component of F in

593
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
this direction that will be the
same of the length of F.

594
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But what is the length of F on
this circle if this length is a?

595
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It is just going to be a.
That is what we said earlier

596
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
about this vector field.
At every point,

597
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
this dot product is a.
Now we know how to integrate

598
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
that quite quickly.

599
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because it becomes the integral
of a ds, but a is a constant so

600
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
we can take it out.
And now what do we get when we

601
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
integrate ds along C?
Well, we should get the total

602
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
length of the curve if we sum
all the little pieces of arc

603
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
length.
But we know that the length of

604
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
a circle of radius a is 2pi a,
so we get 2(pi)a squared.

605
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:01,000
If we were to compute that by
hand, well, what would we do?

606
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We would be computing integral
of minus y dx plus x dy.

607
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Since we are on a circle,
we will probably set x equals a

608
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
times cosine theta,
y equals a times sine theta for

609
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
theta between zero and 2pi.
Then we would get dx and dy out

610
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
of these.
So, y is a sine theta,

611
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
dx is negative a sine theta d
theta, if you differentiate a

612
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
cosine, plus a cosine theta
times a cosine theta d theta.

613
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Well, you will just end up with
integral from zero to 2pi of a

614
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
squared time sine squared theta
plus cosine square theta times d

615
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
theta.
That becomes just one.

616
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And you get the same answer.
It took about the same amount

617
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
of time because I did this one
rushing very quickly,

618
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but normally it takes about at
least twice the amount of time

619
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to do it with a calculation.
That tells you sometimes it is

620
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
worth thinking geometrically.

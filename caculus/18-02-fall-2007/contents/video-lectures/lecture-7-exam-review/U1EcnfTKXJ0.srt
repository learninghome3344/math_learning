7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me just tell you first
about the list of topics.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Basically, the list of topics
is simple.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is everything.
I mean, everything we have seen

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so far is on the exam.
But let me just remind you of

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the main topics that we have
seen.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First of all,
we learned about vectors,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
how to use them,
and dot-product.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
At this point,
you probably should know that

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the dot-product of two vectors
is obtained by summing products

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of components.
And geometrically it is the

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
length of A times the length of
B times the cosine of the angle

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
between them.
And, in particular,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we can use dot-product to
measure angles by solving for

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
cosine theta in this equality.
And most importantly to detect

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
whether two vectors are
perpendicular to each other.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Two vectors are perpendicular
when their dot-product is zero.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Any questions about that?
No.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is everyone reasonably happy
with dot-product by now?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I see a stunned silence.
Nobody happy with dot-product

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
so far?
OK.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you want to look at Practice
1A, a good example of a typical

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
problem with dot-product would
be problem 1.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's see.
We are going to go over the

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
practice exam when I am done
writing this list of topics.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think probably we actually
will skip this problem because I

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
think most of you know how to do
it.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And if not then you should run
for help from me or from your

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
recitation instructor to figure
out how to do it.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The second topic that we saw
was cross-product.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
When you have two vectors in
space, you can just form that

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
cross-product by computing its
determinant.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, implicitly,
we should also know about

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
determinants.
By that I mean two by two and

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
three by three.
Don't worry about larger ones,

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
even if you are interested,
they won't be on the test.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And applications of
cross-product,

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
for example,
finding the area of a triangle

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
or a parallelogram in space.
If you have a triangle in space

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
with sides A and B then its area
is one-half of the length of A

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
cross B.
Because the length of A cross B

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is length A, length B sine
theta, which is the same as the

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
area of the parallelogram formed
by these two vectors.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the other application of
cross-product is to find a

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
vector that's perpendicular to
two given vectors.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In particular,
to find the vector that is

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
normal to a plane and then find
the equation of a plane.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Another application is finding
the normal vector to a plane and

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,000
using that finding the equation
of a plane.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Basically, remember,
to find the equation of a

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
plane, ax by cz = d,
what you need is the normal

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
vector to the plane.
And the components of the

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
normal vector are exactly the
coefficients that go into this.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And we have seen an argument
for why that happens to be the

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
case.
To find a normal vector to a

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
plane typically what we will do
is take two vectors that lie in

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the plane and will take their
cross-product.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And the cross-product will
automatically be perpendicular

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to both of them.
We are going to see an example

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
of that when we look at problem
5 in practice 1A.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think we will try to do that
one.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Another application,
well, we will just mention it

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
as a topic that goes along with
this one.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We have seen also about
equations of lines and how to

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
find where a line intersects a
plane.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just to refresh your memories,
the equation of a line,

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
well, we will be looking at
parametric equations.

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
To know the parametric equation
of a line, we need to know a

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
point on the line and we need to
know a vector that is parallel

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to the line.
And, if we know a point on the

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
line and a vector along the
line,

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
then we can express the
parametric equations for the

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
motion of a point that is moving
on the line.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually, starting at point,
at time zero,

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and moving with velocity v.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To put things in symbolic form,
you will get a position of that

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
point by starting with a
position of time zero and adding

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
t times the vector v.
It gives you x,

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
y and z in terms of t.
And that is how we represent

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
lines.
We will look at problem 5 in a

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
bit, but any general questions
about these topics?

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No.
Do you have a question?

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do we have to know Taylor
series?

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That is a good question.
No, not on the exam.

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
[APPLAUSE]
Taylor series are something you

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
should be aware of,
generally speaking.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It will be useful for you in
real life,

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
probably not when you go to the
supermarket,

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but if you solve engineering
problems you will need Taylor

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
series.
It would be good not to forget

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
them entirely,
but on the 18.02 exams they

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
probably won't be there.
Let me continue with more

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
topics.
And then we can see if you can

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
think of other topics that
should or should not be on the

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
exam.
Third topics would be matrices,

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
linear systems,
inverting matrices.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I know that most of you that
have calculators that can invert

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
matrices, but still you are
expected at this point to know

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
how to do it by hand.
If you have looked at the

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
practice tests,
both of them have a problem

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that asks you to invert a matrix
or at least do part of it.

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And so it is very likely that
tomorrow there will be a problem

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
like that as well.
In general, when a kind of

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
problem is on both practice
tests it's a good indication

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that it might be there also on
the actual exam.

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Unfortunately,
not with the same matrix so you

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
cannot learn the answer by
heart.

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Another thing that we have
learned about,

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
well, I should say this is
going to be problem 3 on the

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
test and will on the practice
test.

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
On the actual test,
too, I think,

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
actually.
Anyway, we will come back to it

118
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
later.
A couple of things that you

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
should remember.
If you have a system of the

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
form AX equals B then there are
two cases.

121
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If a determinant of A is not
zero then that means you can

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
compute the inverse matrix and
you can just solve by taking A

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
inverse times B.
And the other case is when the

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
determinant of A is zero,
and there is either no solution

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
or there is infinitely many
solutions.

126
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In particular,
if you know that there is a

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
solution,
for example,

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if B is zero there always is an
obvious solution,

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
X equals zero,
then you will actually have

130
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
infinitely many.
In general, we don't really

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
know how to tell whether it is
no solution or infinitely many.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Questions about that?
Yes?

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Will we have to know how to
rotate vectors and so on?

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Not in general,
but you might still want to

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
remember how to rotate a vector
in a plane by 90 degrees because

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that has been useful when we
have done problems about

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
parametric equations,
which is what I am coming to

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
next.
What we have seen about

139
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
rotation matrices,
that was the homework part B

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
problem,
you are not supposed to

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
remember by heart everything
that was in part B of your

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
homework.
It is a good idea to have some

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
vague knowledge because it is
useful culture,

144
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I would say,
useful background for later in

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
your lives,
but I won't ask you by heart to

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
know what is the formation for a
rotation matrix.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then we come to,
last by not least,

148
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the problem of finding
parametric equations.

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And, in particular,
possibly by decomposing the

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
position vector into a sum of
simpler vectors.

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You have seen quite an evil
exam of that on the last problem

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
set with this picture that maybe
by now you have had some

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
nightmares about.
Anyway, the one on the exam

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
will certainly be easier than
that.

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But, as you have seen -- I
mean, you should know,

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
basically,
how to analyze a motion that is

157
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
being described to you and
express it in terms of vectors

158
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and then figure out what the
parametric equation will be.

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now, again, it won't be as
complicated on the exam as the

160
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
one in the problem set.
But there are a couple of those

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
on the practice exam,
so that gives you an idea of

162
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
what is realistically expected
of you.

163
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And now once we have parametric
equations for motion,

164
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so that means when we know how
to find the position vector as a

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
function of a parameter maybe of
time,

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
then we have seen also about
velocity and acceleration,

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
which the vector is obtained by
taking the first and second

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
derivatives of a position
vector.

169
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And so one topic that I will
add in there as well is somehow

170
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
how to prove things about
motions by differentiating

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
vector identities.
One example of that,

172
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
for example,
is when we try to look at

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Kepler's law in class last time.
We look at Kepler's second law

174
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
of planetary motion,
and we reduced it to a

175
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
calculation about a derivative
of the cross-product R cross v.

176
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Now, on the exam you don't need
to know the details of Kepler's

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
law,
but you need to be able to

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
manipulate vector quantities a
bit in the way that we did.

179
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And so on practice exam 1A,
you actually have a variety of

180
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
problems on this topics because
you have problems two,

181
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
four and six,
all about parametric motions.

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Probably tomorrow there will
not be three distinct problems

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
about parametric motions,
but maybe a couple of them.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think that is basically the
list of topics.

185
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Anybody spot something that I
have forgotten to put on the

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
exam or questions about
something that should or should

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
not be there?
You go first.

188
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah?
How about parametrizing weird

189
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
trigonometric functions?
I am not sure what you mean by

190
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that.
Well, parametric curves,

191
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
you need to know how to
parameterize motions,

192
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and that involves a little bit
of trigonometrics.

193
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When we have seen these
problems about rotating wheels,

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
say the cycloid,
for example,

195
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and so on there is a bit of
cosine and sine and so on.

196
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think not much more on that.
You won't need obscure

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
trigonometric identities.
You're next.

198
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Any proofs on the exam or just
like problems?

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, a problem can ask you to
show things.

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It is not going to be a
complicated proof.

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The proofs are going to be
fairly easy.

202
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you look at practice 1A,
the last problem does have a

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
little bit of proof.
6B says that show that blah,

204
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
blah, blah.
But, as you will see,

205
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
it is not a difficult kind of
proof.

206
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, about the same.
Yes?

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Are there equations of 3D
shapes that we should know at

208
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
this point?
We should know definitely a lot

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
about the equations of planes on
lines.

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And you should probably know
that a sphere centered at the

211
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
origin is the set of points
where distance to the center is

212
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
equal to the radius of the
sphere.

213
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We don't need more at this
point.

214
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
As the semester goes on,
we will start seeing cones and

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
things like that.
But at this point planes, lines.

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And maybe you need to know
about circles and spheres,

217
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
but nothing beyond that.
More questions?

218
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes?
If there is a formula that you

219
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
have proved on the homework
then, yes, you can assume it on

220
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the test.
Maybe you want to write on your

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
test that this is a formula you
have seen in homework just so

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that we know that you remember
it from homework and not from

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
looking over your neighbor's
shoulder or whatever.

224
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, it is OK to use things
that you know general-speaking.

225
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That being said,
for example,

226
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
probably there will be a linear
system to solve.

227
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It will say on the exam you are
supposed to solve that using

228
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
matrices, not by elimination.
There are things like that.

229
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If a problem says solve by
using vector methods,

230
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
things like that,
then try to use at least a

231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
vector somewhere.
But, in general,

232
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you are allowed to use things
that you know.

233
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes?
Will we need to go from

234
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
parametric equations to xy
equations?

235
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, let's say only if it is
very easy.

236
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If I give you a parametric
curve, sin t,

237
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
sin t, then you should be able
to observe that it is on the

238
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
line y equals x,
not beyond that.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes?
Do we have to use -- Yes.

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know if you will have
to use it, but certainly you

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
should know a little bit about
the unit tangent vector.

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Just remember the main thing to
know that the unit tangent

243
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
vector is velocity divided by
the speed.

244
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I mean there is not much more
to it when you think about it.

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes?
Kepler's law,

246
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
well, you are allowed to use it
if it helps you,

247
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
if you find a way to squeeze it
in.

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You don't have to know Kepler's
law in detail.

249
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You just have to know how to
reproduce the general steps.

250
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If I tell you R cross v is
constant, you might be expected

251
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to know what to do with that.
I would say -- Basically,

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
you don't need to know Kepler's
law.

253
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You need to know the kind of
stuff that we saw when we

254
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
derived it such as how to take
the derivative of a dot-product

255
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:52,000
or a cross-product.
That is basically the answer.

256
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't see any questions
anymore.

257
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, you are raising your hand.
Yes.

258
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
How to calculate the distance
between two lines and the

259
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
distance between two planes?
Well, you have seen,

260
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
probably recently,
that it is quite painful to do

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
in general.
And, no, I don't think that

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
will be on the exam by itself.
You need to know how to compute

263
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the distance between two points.
That certainly you need to know.

264
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And also maybe how to find the
compliment of a vector in a

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
certain direction.
And that is about it,

266
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I would say.
I mean the more you know about

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
things the better.
Things that come up on part Bs

268
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of the problem sets are
interesting things,

269
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but they are usually not needed
on the exams.

270
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If you have more questions then
you are not raising your hand

271
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
high enough for me to see it.
OK.

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's try to do a bit of this
practice exam 1A.

273
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hopefully, everybody has it.
If you don't have it,

274
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
hopefully your neighbor has it.
If you don't have it and your

275
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
neighbor doesn't have it then
please raise your hand.

276
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I have a couple.

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If you neighbor has it then
just follow with them for now.

278
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think there are a few people
behind you over there.

279
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I will stop handing them out
now.

280
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If you really need one,
it is on the website,

281
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
it will be here at the end of
class.

282
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Let's see.
Well, I think we are going to

283
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
just skip problems 1 and 2
because they are pretty

284
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
straightforward and I hope that
you know how to do them.

285
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean I don't know.
Let's see.

286
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How many of you have no problem
with problem 1?

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
How many of you have trouble
with problem 1?

288
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
OK.
How many of you haven't raised

289
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
your hands?
OK.

290
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
How many of you have trouble
with problem 2?

291
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
OK.
Well, if you have questions

292
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
about those, maybe you should
just come see me at the end

293
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
because that is probably more
efficient that way.

294
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I am going to start right away
with problem 3,

295
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
actually.
Problem 3 says we have a matrix

296
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
given to us |1 3 2;
2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|.

297
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And it tells us determinant of
A is 2 and inverse equals

298
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
something, but we are missing
two values A and B and we are

299
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
supposed to find them.
That means we need to do the

300
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:51,000
steps of the algorithm to find
the inverse of A.

301
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We are told that A inverse is
one-half of |1 ...

302
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
...; - 1 - 2 5;
2 2 - 6|.

303
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And here there are two unknown
values.

304
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Remember, to invert a matrix,
first we compute the minors.

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Then we flip some signs to get
the cofactors.

306
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Then we transpose.
And, finally,

307
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
we divide by the determinant.
Let's try to be smart about

308
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
this.
Do we need to compute all nine

309
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
minors?
No.

310
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We only need to compute two of
them, right?

311
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Which minors do we need to
compute?

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Here and here or here and here?
Yeah, that looks better.

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Because, remember,
we need to transpose things so

314
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
these two guys will end up here.
I claim we should compute these

315
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
two minors.
And we will see if that is good

316
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
enough.
If you start doing others and

317
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you find that they don't end up
in the right place then just do

318
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
more,
but you don't need to spend

319
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
your time computing all nine of
them.

320
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If you are worried about not
doing it right then,

321
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
of course, you can maybe
compute one or two more to just

322
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
double-check your answers.
But let us just do those that

323
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
we think are needed.
The matrix of minors.

324
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The one that goes in the middle
position is obtained by deleting

325
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this row and that column,
and we are left with a

326
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
determinant |3 2;1 0|,
3 times 0 minus 1 times 2

327
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
should be - 2 should be - 2.
Then the one in the lower left

328
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
corner, we delete the last row
and the first column,

329
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we are left with |3 2;
0 - 1|.

330
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
3 times (- 1) is negative 3
minus 0.

331
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We are still left with negative
three.

332
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Is that step clear for everyone?
Then we need to go to cofactors.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That means we need to change
signs.

334
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The rule is -- We change signs
in basically these four places.

335
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That means we will be left with
positive 2 and negative 3.

336
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Then we take the transpose.
That means the first column

337
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
will copy into the first row,
so this guy we still don't

338
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
know,
but here we will have two and

339
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
here we will have minus three.
Finally, we have to divide by

340
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the determinant of A.
And here we are actually told

341
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that the determinant of A is
two.

342
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So we will divide by two.
But there is only one-half here

343
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so actually it is done for us.
The values that we will put up

344
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
there are going to be 2 and
negative 3.

345
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now let's see how we use that
to solve a linear system.

346
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If we have to solve a linear
system, Ax equals B,

347
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
well, if the matrix is
invertible, its determinant is

348
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
not zero,
so we can certainly write x

349
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
equals A inverse B.
So we have to multiply,

350
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that is one-half | 1 2 - 3;
- 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|.

351
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Times B [
1, - 2,1].

352
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Remember, to do a matrix
multiplication you take the rows

353
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
in here, the columns in here and
you do dot-products.

354
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The first entry will be one
times one plus two times minus

355
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
two plus minus three times one,
one minus four minus three

356
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
should be negative six,
except I still have,

357
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
of course, a one-half in front.
Then minus one plus four plus

358
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
five should be 8.
Two minus four minus six should

359
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
be -8.
That will simplify to [- 3,4,

360
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
- 5].
Any questions about that?

361
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
OK.
Now we come to part C which is

362
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the harder part of this problem.
It says let's take this matrix

363
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
A and let's replace the two in
the upper right corner by some

364
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
other number C.
That means we will look at 1 3

365
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
C; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|.
And let's call that M.

366
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And it first asks you to find
the value of C for which this

367
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
matrix is not invertible.
M is not invertible exactly

368
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
when the determinant of M is
zero.

369
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Let's compute the determinant.
Well, we should do one times

370
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that smaller determinant,
which is zero minus negative

371
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
one,
which is 1 times 1 minus three

372
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
times that determinant,
which is zero plus one is 1.

373
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And then we have plus C times
the lower left determinant which

374
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
is two times one minus zero is
2.

375
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That gives us one minus three
is - 2 2C.

376
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That is zero when C equals 1.
For C equals 1,

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
this matrix is not invertible.
For other values it is

378
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
invertible.
It goes on to say let's look at

379
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
this value of C and let's look
at the system Mx equals zero.

380
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I am going to put value one in
there.

381
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Now, if we look at Mx equals
zero, well, this has either no

382
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
solution or infinitely many
solutions.

383
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But here there is an obvious
solution.

384
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Namely x equals zero is a
solution.

385
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Maybe let me rewrite it more
geometrically.

386
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,000
X 3 y z = 0.
2x - z = 0.

387
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And x y = 0.
You see we have an obvious

388
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
solution, (0,0,
0).

389
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But we have more solutions.
How do we find more solutions?

390
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Well, (x, y,
z) is a solution if it is in

391
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
all three of these planes.
That is a way to think about it.

392
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Probably we are actually in
this situation where,

393
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in fact, we have three planes
that are all passing through the

394
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
origin and all parallel to the
same line.

395
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And so that would be the line
of solutions.

396
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
To find it actually we can
think of this as follows.

397
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The first observation is that
actually in this situation we

398
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
don't need all three equations.
The fact that the system has

399
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
infinitely many solutions means
that actually one of the

400
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
equations is redundant.
If you look at it long enough

401
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
you will see,
for example,

402
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
if you multiply three times
this equation and you subtract

403
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
that one then you will get the
first equation.

404
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Three times (x y) - (2x - z)
will be x 3y z.

405
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now, we don't actually need to
see that to solve a problem.

406
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I am just showing you that is
what happens when you have a

407
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
matrix with determinant zero.
One of the equations is somehow

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
a duplicate of the others.
We don't actually need to

409
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
figure out how exactly.
What that means is really we

410
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
want to solve,
let's say start with two of the

411
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
equations.
To find the solution we can

412
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
observe that the first equation
says actually that <x,

413
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
y, z> dot-product with

414
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
=0.
And the second equation says

415
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
dot-product with <2,0,-
1> is zero.

416
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And the third equation,
if we really want to keep it,

417
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
says we should be also having
this.

418
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Now, these equations now
written like this,

419
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
they are just saying we want an
x, y, z that is perpendicular to

420
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
these vectors.
Let's forget this one and let's

421
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
just look at these two.
They are saying we want a

422
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
vector that is perpendicular to
these two given vectors.

423
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
How do we find that?
We do the cross-product.

424
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
To find x, y,
z perpendicular to <1,3,

425
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
1> and <2,0,
- 1>, we take the

426
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
cross-product.
And that will give us

427
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
something.
Well, let me just give you the

428
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
answer.
I am sure you know how to do

429
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
cross-products by now.
I don't have the answer here,

430
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:18,000
so I guess I have to do it.
That should be <- 3,

431
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
probably positive 3,
and then - 6>.

432
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That is the solution.
And any multiple of that is a

433
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
solution.
If you like to neatly simplify

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
them you could say negative one,
one, negative two.

435
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
If you like larger numbers you
can multiply that by a million.

436
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That is also a solution.
Any questions about that?

437
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yes?
That is correct.

438
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If you pick these two guys
instead, you will get the same

439
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
solution.
Well, up to a multiple.

440
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It could be if you do the
cross-product of these two guys

441
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you actually get something that
is a multiple -- Actually,

442
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think if you do the
cross-product of the first and

443
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
third one you will get actually
minus one, one,

444
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
minus two, the smaller one.
But it doesn't matter.

445
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean it is really in the same
direction.

446
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This is all because a plane has
actually normal vectors of all

447
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
sizes.
Yes?

448
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't think so because -- An
important thing to remember

449
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
about cross-product is we
compute for minors,

450
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but then we put a minus sign on
the second component.

451
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The coefficient of j in here,
the second component,

452
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
you do one times minus two
times one.

453
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That is negative three indeed.
But then you actually change

454
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that to a positive three.
Yes?

455
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Well, we don't have parametric
equations here.

456
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Oh, solving by elimination.
Well, if it says that you have

457
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
to use vector methods then you
should use vector methods.

458
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
If it says you should use
vectors and matrices then you

459
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
are expected to do it that way.
Yes?

460
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It depends what the problem is
asking.

461
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The question is,
is it enough to find the

462
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
components of a vector or do we
have to find the equation of a

463
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
line?
Here it says find one solution

464
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
using vector operations.
We have found one solution.

465
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If you wanted to find the line
then it would all the things

466
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that are proportional to this.
It would be maybe minus 3t,

467
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
3t minus 6t,
all the multiples of that

468
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
vector.
We do because (0,0,

469
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
0) is an obvious solution.
Maybe I should write that on

470
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the board.
You had another question?

471
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Not quite.
Let me re-explain first how we

472
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
get all the solutions and why I
did that cross-product.

473
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
First of all,
why did I take that

474
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
cross-product again?
I took that cross-product

475
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
because I looked at my three
equations and I observed that my

476
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
three equations can be
reformulated in terms of these

477
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
dot-products saying that x,
y, z is actually perpendicular

478
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
these guys and these guys have
normal vectors to the planes.

479
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Remember, to be in all three
planes it has to be

480
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
perpendicular to the normal
vectors.

481
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That is how we got here.
And now, if we want something

482
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
that is perpendicular to a bunch
of given vectors,

483
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
well, to be perpendicular to
two vectors,

484
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
an easy way to find one is to
take that cross-product.

485
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And, if you take any two of
them, you will get something

486
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
that is the same up to scaling.
Now, what it means

487
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
geometrically is that when we
have our three planes and they

488
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
all actually contain the same
line -- And we know that is

489
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
actually the smae case because
they all pass through the

490
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
origin.
They pass through the origin

491
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
because the constant terms are
just zero.

492
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What happens is that the normal
vectors to these planes are,

493
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
in fact, all perpendicular to
that line.

494
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The normal vectors -- Say this
line is vertical.

495
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The normal vectors are all
going to be horizontal.

496
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Well, it is kind of hard to
draw.

497
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
By taking the cross-product
between two normal vectors we

498
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:01,000
found this direction.
Now, to find actually all the

499
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
solutions.
What we know so far is that we

500
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
have this direction <-3 3 -
6>.

501
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That is going to be parallel to
the line of intersections.

502
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Let me do it here,
for example,

503
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:29,000
.
Now we have one particular

504
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
solution.
0,0, 0.

505
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Actually, we have found another
one, too, which is <- 3,3,

506
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
- 6>.
Anyway, if a line of solutions

507
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:55,000
-- -- has parametric equation x
= - 3t, y = 3t,

508
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
z = - 6t, anything proportional
to that.

509
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That is how we would find all
the solutions if we wanted them.

510
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It is almost time.
I think I need to jump ahead to

511
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
other problems.
Let's see.

512
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I think problem 4 you can
probably find for yourselves.

513
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It is a reasonably
straightforward parametric

514
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
equation problem.
You just have to find the

515
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
coordinates of point P.
And for that it is a very

516
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
simple trick.
Problem 5.

517
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Find the area of a spaced
triangle.

518
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It sounds like a cross-product.
Find the equation of a plane

519
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
also sounds like a
cross-product.

520
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And find the intersection of
this plane with a line means we

521
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
find first the parametric
equation of the line and then we

522
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
plug that into the equation of
the plane to get where they

523
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
intersect.
Does that sound reasonable?

524
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Who is disparate about problem
5?

525
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:15,000
OK. Let me repeat problem 5.
First part we need to find the

526
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
area of a triangle.
And the way to do that is to

527
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
just do one-half the length of a
cross-product.

528
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If we have three points,
P0, P1, P2 then maybe we can

529
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
form vectors P0P1 and P0P2.
And, if we take that

530
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
cross-product and take the
length of that and divide by

531
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
two, that will give us the area
of a triangle.

532
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Here it turns out that this guy
is ,

533
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,000
if I look at the solutions,
so you will end up with square

534
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
root of 6 over 2.
The second is asking you for

535
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
the equation of a plane
containing these three points.

536
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Well, first of all,
we know that a normal vector to

537
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the plane is going to be given
by this cross-product again.

538
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That means that the equation of
plane will be of a form x plus y

539
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
plus 2z equals something.
If a coefficient is here it

540
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
comes from the normal vector.
And to find what goes in the

541
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
right-hand side,
we just plug in any of the

542
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
points.
If you plug in P0,

543
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
which is (2,1,
0) then two plus one seems like

544
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
it is 3.
And, if you want to

545
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
double-check your answer,
you can take P1 and P2 and

546
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
check that you also get three.
It is a good way to check your

547
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
answer.
Then the third part.

548
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We have a line parallel to the
vector v equals one,

549
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
one, one through the point S,
which is (- 1,0,

550
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
0).
That means you can find its

551
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
parametric equation.
X will start at - 1,

552
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
increases at rate 1.
Y starts at zero,

553
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
increases at rate one.
Z starts at zero,

554
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
increases at rate one.
You plug these into the plane

555
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
equation, and that will tell you
where they intersect.

556
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Is that clear?
And now, in the last one

557
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
minute,
on that side I have one minute,

558
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
let me just say very quickly --
Well,

559
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
do you want to hear about
problem 6 anyway very quickly?

560
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah. OK.
Problem 6 is one of these like

561
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
vector calculations.
It says we have a position

562
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
vector R.
And it asks you how do we find

563
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
the derivative of R dot R?
Well, remember we have a

564
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
product rule for taking the
derivative.

565
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
UV prime is U prime V plus UV
prime.

566
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It also applies for dot-product.
That is dR by dt dot R plus R

567
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
dot dR by dt.
And these are both the same

568
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
thing.
You get two R dot dR/dt,

569
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
but dR/dt is v for velocity
vector.

570
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Hopefully you have seen things
like that.

571
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, it says show that if R has
constant length then they are

572
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
perpendicular.
All you need to write basically

573
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
is we assume length R is
constant.

574
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That is what it says,
R has constant length.

575
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Well, how do we get to,
say, something we probably want

576
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
to reduce to that?
Well, if R is constant in

577
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
length then R dot R is also
constant.

578
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And so that means d by dt of R
dot R is zero.

579
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That is what it means to be
constant.

580
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And so that means R dot v is
zero.

581
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That means R is perpendicular
to v.

582
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That is a proof.
It is not a scary proof.

583
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And then the last question of
the exam says let's continue to

584
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
assume that R has constant
length, and let's try to find R

585
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
dot v.
If there is acceleration then

586
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
probably we should bring it in
somewhere, maybe by taking a

587
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
derivative of something.
If we know that R dot v equals

588
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
zero, let's take the derivative
of that.

589
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That is still zero.
But now, using the product

590
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
rule, dR/dt is v dot v plus R
dot dv/dt is going to be zero.

591
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That means that you are asked
about R dot A.

592
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Well, that is equal to minus V
dot V.

593
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And that is it.

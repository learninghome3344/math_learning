To make a donation or to view</span> <span m="13000">additional materials from hundreds of MIT courses,</span> <span m="18000">visit MIT OpenCourseWare at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m="23000">Let me just tell you first about the list of topics.</span> <span m="29000">Basically, the list of topics is simple.</span> <span m="35000">It is everything. I mean, everything we have seen</span> <span m="42000">so far is on the exam. But let me just remind you of</span> <span m="48000">the main topics that we have seen.</span> <span m="52000">First of all, we learned about vectors,</span> <span m="58000">how to use them, and dot-product.</span> <span m="63000">At this point, you probably should know that</span> <span m="67000">the dot-product of two vectors is obtained by summing products</span> <span m="73000">of components. And geometrically it is the</span> <span m="79000">length of A times the length of B times the cosine of the angle</span> <span m="89000">between them. And, in particular,</span> <span m="94000">we can use dot-product to measure angles by solving for</span> <span m="101000">cosine theta in this equality. And most importantly to detect</span> <span m="109000">whether two vectors are perpendicular to each other.</span> <span m="114000">Two vectors are perpendicular when their dot-product is zero.</span> <span m="120000">Any questions about that? No.</span> <span m="127000">Is everyone reasonably happy with dot-product by now?</span> <span m="135000">I see a stunned silence. Nobody happy with dot-product</span> <span m="139000">so far? OK.</span> <span m="148000">If you want to look at Practice 1A, a good example of a typical</span> <span m="156000">problem with dot-product would be problem 1.</span> <span m="161000">Let's see. We are going to go over the</span> <span m="163000">practice exam when I am done writing this list of topics.</span> <span m="166000">I think probably we actually will skip this problem because I</span> <span m="169000">think most of you know how to do it.</span> <span m="171000">And if not then you should run for help from me or from your</span> <span m="177000">recitation instructor to figure out how to do it.</span> <span m="182000">The second topic that we saw was cross-product.</span> <span m="190000">When you have two vectors in space, you can just form that</span> <span m="199000">cross-product by computing its determinant.</span> <span m="205000">So, implicitly, we should also know about</span> <span m="211000">determinants. By that I mean two by two and</span> <span m="215000">three by three. Don't worry about larger ones,</span> <span m="218000">even if you are interested, they won't be on the test.</span> <span m="223000">And applications of cross-product,</span> <span m="229000">for example, finding the area of a triangle</span> <span m="235000">or a parallelogram in space. If you have a triangle in space</span> <span m="244000">with sides A and B then its area is one-half of the length of A</span> <span m="250000">cross B. Because the length of A cross B</span> <span m="254000">is length A, length B sine theta, which is the same as the</span> <span m="259000">area of the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.</span> <span m="264000">And the other application of cross-product is to find a</span> <span m="268000">vector that's perpendicular to two given vectors.</span> <span m="272000">In particular, to find the vector that is</span> <span m="276000">normal to a plane and then find the equation of a plane.</span> <span m="282000">Another application is finding the normal vector to a plane and</span> <span m="297000">using that finding the equation of a plane.</span> <span m="308000">Basically, remember, to find the equation of a</span> <span m="316000">plane, ax by cz = d, what you need is the normal</span> <span m="323000">vector to the plane. And the components of the</span> <span m="329000">normal vector are exactly the coefficients that go into this.</span> <span m="332000">And we have seen an argument for why that happens to be the</span> <span m="338000">case. To find a normal vector to a</span> <span m="340000">plane typically what we will do is take two vectors that lie in</span> <span m="344000">the plane and will take their cross-product.</span> <span m="347000">And the cross-product will automatically be perpendicular</span> <span m="354000">to both of them. We are going to see an example</span> <span m="359000">of that when we look at problem 5 in practice 1A.</span> <span m="364000">I think we will try to do that one.</span> <span m="372000">Another application, well, we will just mention it</span> <span m="377000">as a topic that goes along with this one.</span> <span m="381000">We have seen also about equations of lines and how to</span> <span m="394000">find where a line intersects a plane.</span> <span m="403000">Just to refresh your memories, the equation of a line,</span> <span m="406000">well, we will be looking at parametric equations.</span> <span m="410000">To know the parametric equation of a line, we need to know a</span> <span m="414000">point on the line and we need to know a vector that is parallel</span> <span m="419000">to the line. And, if we know a point on the</span> <span m="423000">line and a vector along the line,</span> <span m="426000">then we can express the parametric equations for the</span> <span m="431000">motion of a point that is moving on the line.</span> <span m="436000">Actually, starting at point, at time zero,</span> <span m="439000">and moving with velocity v.</span> <span m="458000">To put things in symbolic form, you will get a position of that</span> <span m="464000">point by starting with a position of time zero and adding</span> <span m="468000">t times the vector v. It gives you x,</span> <span m="473000">y and z in terms of t. And that is how we represent</span> <span m="480000">lines. We will look at problem 5 in a</span> <span m="486000">bit, but any general questions about these topics?</span> <span m="495000">No. Do you have a question?</span> <span m="500000">Do we have to know Taylor series?</span> <span m="506000">That is a good question. No, not on the exam.</span> <span m="514000">[APPLAUSE] Taylor series are something you</span> <span m="516000">should be aware of, generally speaking.</span> <span m="518000">It will be useful for you in real life,</span> <span m="520000">probably not when you go to the supermarket,</span> <span m="524000">but if you solve engineering problems you will need Taylor</span> <span m="528000">series. It would be good not to forget</span> <span m="532000">them entirely, but on the 18.02 exams they</span> <span m="538000">probably won't be there. Let me continue with more</span> <span m="543000">topics. And then we can see if you can</span> <span m="546000">think of other topics that should or should not be on the</span> <span m="551000">exam. Third topics would be matrices,</span> <span m="562000">linear systems, inverting matrices.</span> <span m="574000">I know that most of you that have calculators that can invert</span> <span m="577000">matrices, but still you are expected at this point to know</span> <span m="580000">how to do it by hand. If you have looked at the</span> <span m="582000">practice tests, both of them have a problem</span> <span m="584000">that asks you to invert a matrix or at least do part of it.</span> <span m="587000">And so it is very likely that tomorrow there will be a problem</span> <span m="593000">like that as well. In general, when a kind of</span> <span m="597000">problem is on both practice tests it's a good indication</span> <span m="600000">that it might be there also on the actual exam.</span> <span m="604000">Unfortunately, not with the same matrix so you</span> <span m="608000">cannot learn the answer by heart.</span> <span m="612000">Another thing that we have learned about,</span> <span m="617000">well, I should say this is going to be problem 3 on the</span> <span m="624000">test and will on the practice test.</span> <span m="629000">On the actual test, too, I think,</span> <span m="633000">actually. Anyway, we will come back to it</span> <span m="637000">later. A couple of things that you</span> <span m="639000">should remember. If you have a system of the</span> <span m="642000">form AX equals B then there are two cases.</span> <span m="646000">If a determinant of A is not zero then that means you can</span> <span m="651000">compute the inverse matrix and you can just solve by taking A</span> <span m="656000">inverse times B. And the other case is when the</span> <span m="662000">determinant of A is zero, and there is either no solution</span> <span m="671000">or there is infinitely many solutions.</span> <span m="678000">In particular, if you know that there is a</span> <span m="680000">solution, for example,</span> <span m="681000">if B is zero there always is an obvious solution,</span> <span m="684000">X equals zero, then you will actually have</span> <span m="688000">infinitely many. In general, we don't really</span> <span m="690000">know how to tell whether it is no solution or infinitely many.</span> <span m="703000">Questions about that? Yes?</span> <span m="712000">Will we have to know how to rotate vectors and so on?</span> <span m="718000">Not in general, but you might still want to</span> <span m="721000">remember how to rotate a vector in a plane by 90 degrees because</span> <span m="724000">that has been useful when we have done problems about</span> <span m="727000">parametric equations, which is what I am coming to</span> <span m="730000">next. What we have seen about</span> <span m="732000">rotation matrices, that was the homework part B</span> <span m="735000">problem, you are not supposed to</span> <span m="737000">remember by heart everything that was in part B of your</span> <span m="741000">homework. It is a good idea to have some</span> <span m="744000">vague knowledge because it is useful culture,</span> <span m="747000">I would say, useful background for later in</span> <span m="748000">your lives, but I won't ask you by heart to</span> <span m="753000">know what is the formation for a rotation matrix.</span> <span m="760000">And then we come to, last by not least,</span> <span m="769000">the problem of finding parametric equations.</span> <span m="780000">And, in particular, possibly by decomposing the</span> <span m="783000">position vector into a sum of simpler vectors.</span> <span m="786000">You have seen quite an evil exam of that on the last problem</span> <span m="793000">set with this picture that maybe by now you have had some</span> <span m="799000">nightmares about. Anyway, the one on the exam</span> <span m="803000">will certainly be easier than that.</span> <span m="807000">But, as you have seen -- I mean, you should know,</span> <span m="816000">basically, how to analyze a motion that is</span> <span m="820000">being described to you and express it in terms of vectors</span> <span m="824000">and then figure out what the parametric equation will be.</span> <span m="828000">Now, again, it won't be as complicated on the exam as the</span> <span m="832000">one in the problem set. But there are a couple of those</span> <span m="837000">on the practice exam, so that gives you an idea of</span> <span m="841000">what is realistically expected of you.</span> <span m="844000">And now once we have parametric equations for motion,</span> <span m="849000">so that means when we know how to find the position vector as a</span> <span m="853000">function of a parameter maybe of time,</span> <span m="855000">then we have seen also about velocity and acceleration,</span> <span m="864000">which the vector is obtained by taking the first and second</span> <span m="868000">derivatives of a position vector.</span> <span m="871000">And so one topic that I will add in there as well is somehow</span> <span m="881000">how to prove things about motions by differentiating</span> <span m="890000">vector identities. One example of that,</span> <span m="895000">for example, is when we try to look at</span> <span m="898000">Kepler's law in class last time. We look at Kepler's second law</span> <span m="903000">of planetary motion, and we reduced it to a</span> <span m="906000">calculation about a derivative of the cross-product R cross v.</span> <span m="910000">Now, on the exam you don't need to know the details of Kepler's</span> <span m="914000">law, but you need to be able to</span> <span m="916000">manipulate vector quantities a bit in the way that we did.</span> <span m="922000">And so on practice exam 1A, you actually have a variety of</span> <span m="927000">problems on this topics because you have problems two,</span> <span m="930000">four and six, all about parametric motions.</span> <span m="936000">Probably tomorrow there will not be three distinct problems</span> <span m="942000">about parametric motions, but maybe a couple of them.</span> <span m="948000">I think that is basically the list of topics.</span> <span m="951000">Anybody spot something that I have forgotten to put on the</span> <span m="954000">exam or questions about something that should or should</span> <span m="958000">not be there? You go first.</span> <span m="963000">Yeah? How about parametrizing weird</span> <span m="971000">trigonometric functions? I am not sure what you mean by</span> <span m="978000">that. Well, parametric curves,</span> <span m="981000">you need to know how to parameterize motions,</span> <span m="985000">and that involves a little bit of trigonometrics.</span> <span m="990000">When we have seen these problems about rotating wheels,</span> <span m="993000">say the cycloid, for example,</span> <span m="994000">and so on there is a bit of cosine and sine and so on.</span> <span m="998000">I think not much more on that. You won't need obscure</span> <span m="1001000">trigonometric identities. You're next.</span> <span m="1008000">Any proofs on the exam or just like problems?</span> <span m="1011000">Well, a problem can ask you to show things.</span> <span m="1015000">It is not going to be a complicated proof.</span> <span m="1018000">The proofs are going to be fairly easy.</span> <span m="1020000">If you look at practice 1A, the last problem does have a</span> <span m="1024000">little bit of proof. 6B says that show that blah,</span> <span m="1028000">blah, blah. But, as you will see,</span> <span m="1031000">it is not a difficult kind of proof.</span> <span m="1033000">So, about the same. Yes?</span> <span m="1044000">Are there equations of 3D shapes that we should know at</span> <span m="1049000">this point? We should know definitely a lot</span> <span m="1052000">about the equations of planes on lines.</span> <span m="1054000">And you should probably know that a sphere centered at the</span> <span m="1057000">origin is the set of points where distance to the center is</span> <span m="1060000">equal to the radius of the sphere.</span> <span m="1063000">We don't need more at this point.</span> <span m="1065000">As the semester goes on, we will start seeing cones and</span> <span m="1068000">things like that. But at this point planes, lines.</span> <span m="1072000">And maybe you need to know about circles and spheres,</span> <span m="1078000">but nothing beyond that. More questions?</span> <span m="1083000">Yes? If there is a formula that you</span> <span m="1091000">have proved on the homework then, yes, you can assume it on</span> <span m="1094000">the test. Maybe you want to write on your</span> <span m="1097000">test that this is a formula you have seen in homework just so</span> <span m="1100000">that we know that you remember it from homework and not from</span> <span m="1104000">looking over your neighbor's shoulder or whatever.</span> <span m="1107000">Yes, it is OK to use things that you know general-speaking.</span> <span m="1111000">That being said, for example,</span> <span m="1113000">probably there will be a linear system to solve.</span> <span m="1117000">It will say on the exam you are supposed to solve that using</span> <span m="1120000">matrices, not by elimination. There are things like that.</span> <span m="1123000">If a problem says solve by using vector methods,</span> <span m="1127000">things like that, then try to use at least a</span> <span m="1131000">vector somewhere. But, in general,</span> <span m="1134000">you are allowed to use things that you know.</span> <span m="1138000">Yes? Will we need to go from</span> <span m="1147000">parametric equations to xy equations?</span> <span m="1149000">Well, let's say only if it is very easy.</span> <span m="1156000">If I give you a parametric curve, sin t,</span> <span m="1159000">sin t, then you should be able to observe that it is on the</span> <span m="1165000">line y equals x, not beyond that.</span> <span m="1169000">Yes? Do we have to use -- Yes.</span> <span m="1177000">I don't know if you will have to use it, but certainly you</span> <span m="1180000">should know a little bit about the unit tangent vector.</span> <span m="1183000">Just remember the main thing to know that the unit tangent</span> <span m="1191000">vector is velocity divided by the speed.</span> <span m="1197000">I mean there is not much more to it when you think about it.</span> <span m="1204000">Yes? Kepler's law,</span> <span m="1211000">well, you are allowed to use it if it helps you,</span> <span m="1213000">if you find a way to squeeze it in.</span> <span m="1216000">You don't have to know Kepler's law in detail.</span> <span m="1220000">You just have to know how to reproduce the general steps.</span> <span m="1222000">If I tell you R cross v is constant, you might be expected</span> <span m="1228000">to know what to do with that. I would say -- Basically,</span> <span m="1233000">you don't need to know Kepler's law.</span> <span m="1236000">You need to know the kind of stuff that we saw when we</span> <span m="1238000">derived it such as how to take the derivative of a dot-product</span> <span m="1241000">or a cross-product. That is basically the answer.</span> <span m="1252000">I don't see any questions anymore.</span> <span m="1255000">Oh, you are raising your hand. Yes.</span> <span m="1263000">How to calculate the distance between two lines and the</span> <span m="1266000">distance between two planes? Well, you have seen,</span> <span m="1268000">probably recently, that it is quite painful to do</span> <span m="1270000">in general. And, no, I don't think that</span> <span m="1273000">will be on the exam by itself. You need to know how to compute</span> <span m="1276000">the distance between two points. That certainly you need to know.</span> <span m="1279000">And also maybe how to find the compliment of a vector in a</span> <span m="1284000">certain direction. And that is about it,</span> <span m="1288000">I would say. I mean the more you know about</span> <span m="1293000">things the better. Things that come up on part Bs</span> <span m="1298000">of the problem sets are interesting things,</span> <span m="1303000">but they are usually not needed on the exams.</span> <span m="1308000">If you have more questions then you are not raising your hand</span> <span m="1313000">high enough for me to see it. OK.</span> <span m="1315000">Let's try to do a bit of this practice exam 1A.</span> <span m="1320000">Hopefully, everybody has it. If you don't have it,</span> <span m="1323000">hopefully your neighbor has it. If you don't have it and your</span> <span m="1327000">neighbor doesn't have it then please raise your hand.</span> <span m="1329000">I have a couple.</span> <span m="1377000">If you neighbor has it then just follow with them for now.</span> <span m="1382000">I think there are a few people behind you over there.</span> <span m="1385000">I will stop handing them out now.</span> <span m="1386000">If you really need one, it is on the website,</span> <span m="1391000">it will be here at the end of class.</span> <span m="1395000">Let's see. Well, I think we are going to</span> <span m="1403000">just skip problems 1 and 2 because they are pretty</span> <span m="1407000">straightforward and I hope that you know how to do them.</span> <span m="1412000">I mean I don't know. Let's see.</span> <span m="1417000">How many of you have no problem with problem 1?</span> <span m="1422000">How many of you have trouble with problem 1?</span> <span m="1426000">OK. How many of you haven't raised</span> <span m="1430000">your hands? OK.</span> <span m="1432000">How many of you have trouble with problem 2?</span> <span m="1436000">OK. Well, if you have questions</span> <span m="1438000">about those, maybe you should just come see me at the end</span> <span m="1441000">because that is probably more efficient that way.</span> <span m="1444000">I am going to start right away with problem 3,</span> <span m="1451000">actually. Problem 3 says we have a matrix</span> <span m="1458000">given to us |1 3 2; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|.</span> <span m="1465000">And it tells us determinant of A is 2 and inverse equals</span> <span m="1470000">something, but we are missing two values A and B and we are</span> <span m="1474000">supposed to find them. That means we need to do the</span> <span m="1481000">steps of the algorithm to find the inverse of A.</span> <span m="1491000">We are told that A inverse is one-half of |1 ...</span> <span m="1500000">...; - 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|.</span> <span m="1506000">And here there are two unknown values.</span> <span m="1510000">Remember, to invert a matrix, first we compute the minors.</span> <span m="1515000">Then we flip some signs to get the cofactors.</span> <span m="1517000">Then we transpose. And, finally,</span> <span m="1519000">we divide by the determinant. Let's try to be smart about</span> <span m="1523000">this. Do we need to compute all nine</span> <span m="1526000">minors? No.</span> <span m="1527000">We only need to compute two of them, right?</span> <span m="1530000">Which minors do we need to compute?</span> <span m="1534000">Here and here or here and here? Yeah, that looks better.</span> <span m="1539000">Because, remember, we need to transpose things so</span> <span m="1543000">these two guys will end up here. I claim we should compute these</span> <span m="1548000">two minors. And we will see if that is good</span> <span m="1551000">enough. If you start doing others and</span> <span m="1552000">you find that they don't end up in the right place then just do</span> <span m="1556000">more, but you don't need to spend</span> <span m="1558000">your time computing all nine of them.</span> <span m="1560000">If you are worried about not doing it right then,</span> <span m="1563000">of course, you can maybe compute one or two more to just</span> <span m="1566000">double-check your answers. But let us just do those that</span> <span m="1571000">we think are needed. The matrix of minors.</span> <span m="1576000">The one that goes in the middle position is obtained by deleting</span> <span m="1582000">this row and that column, and we are left with a</span> <span m="1586000">determinant |3 2;1 0|, 3 times 0 minus 1 times 2</span> <span m="1592000">should be - 2 should be - 2. Then the one in the lower left</span> <span m="1600000">corner, we delete the last row and the first column,</span> <span m="1605000">we are left with |3 2; 0 - 1|.</span> <span m="1607000">3 times (- 1) is negative 3 minus 0.</span> <span m="1610000">We are still left with negative three.</span> <span m="1618000">Is that step clear for everyone? Then we need to go to cofactors.</span> <span m="1628000">That means we need to change signs.</span> <span m="1630000">The rule is -- We change signs in basically these four places.</span> <span m="1644000">That means we will be left with positive 2 and negative 3.</span> <span m="1652000">Then we take the transpose. That means the first column</span> <span m="1664000">will copy into the first row, so this guy we still don't</span> <span m="1669000">know, but here we will have two and</span> <span m="1672000">here we will have minus three. Finally, we have to divide by</span> <span m="1679000">the determinant of A. And here we are actually told</span> <span m="1685000">that the determinant of A is two.</span> <span m="1688000">So we will divide by two. But there is only one-half here</span> <span m="1692000">so actually it is done for us. The values that we will put up</span> <span m="1698000">there are going to be 2 and negative 3.</span> <span m="1710000">Now let's see how we use that to solve a linear system.</span> <span m="1718000">If we have to solve a linear system, Ax equals B,</span> <span m="1726000">well, if the matrix is invertible, its determinant is</span> <span m="1730000">not zero, so we can certainly write x</span> <span m="1734000">equals A inverse B. So we have to multiply,</span> <span m="1741000">that is one-half | 1 2 - 3; - 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|.</span> <span m="1749000">Times B [ 1, - 2,1].</span> <span m="1754000">Remember, to do a matrix multiplication you take the rows</span> <span m="1757000">in here, the columns in here and you do dot-products.</span> <span m="1761000">The first entry will be one times one plus two times minus</span> <span m="1765000">two plus minus three times one, one minus four minus three</span> <span m="1770000">should be negative six, except I still have,</span> <span m="1775000">of course, a one-half in front. Then minus one plus four plus</span> <span m="1783000">five should be 8. Two minus four minus six should</span> <span m="1790000">be -8. That will simplify to [- 3,4,</span> <span m="1797000">- 5]. Any questions about that?</span> <span m="1804000">OK. Now we come to part C which is</span> <span m="1808000">the harder part of this problem. It says let's take this matrix</span> <span m="1813000">A and let's replace the two in the upper right corner by some</span> <span m="1817000">other number C. That means we will look at 1 3</span> <span m="1825000">C; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|. And let's call that M.</span> <span m="1834000">And it first asks you to find the value of C for which this</span> <span m="1840000">matrix is not invertible. M is not invertible exactly</span> <span m="1848000">when the determinant of M is zero.</span> <span m="1853000">Let's compute the determinant. Well, we should do one times</span> <span m="1865000">that smaller determinant, which is zero minus negative</span> <span m="1872000">one, which is 1 times 1 minus three</span> <span m="1876000">times that determinant, which is zero plus one is 1.</span> <span m="1883000">And then we have plus C times the lower left determinant which</span> <span m="1888000">is two times one minus zero is 2.</span> <span m="1891000">That gives us one minus three is - 2 2C.</span> <span m="1899000">That is zero when C equals 1. For C equals 1,</span> <span m="1907000">this matrix is not invertible. For other values it is</span> <span m="1913000">invertible. It goes on to say let's look at</span> <span m="1918000">this value of C and let's look at the system Mx equals zero.</span> <span m="1924000">I am going to put value one in there.</span> <span m="1934000">Now, if we look at Mx equals zero, well, this has either no</span> <span m="1940000">solution or infinitely many solutions.</span> <span m="1944000">But here there is an obvious solution.</span> <span m="1946000">Namely x equals zero is a solution.</span> <span m="1950000">Maybe let me rewrite it more geometrically.</span> <span m="1955000">X 3 y z = 0. 2x - z = 0.</span> <span m="1964000">And x y = 0. You see we have an obvious</span> <span m="1972000">solution, (0,0, 0).</span> <span m="1974000">But we have more solutions. How do we find more solutions?</span> <span m="1977000">Well, (x, y, z) is a solution if it is in</span> <span m="1981000">all three of these planes. That is a way to think about it.</span> <span m="1986000">Probably we are actually in this situation where,</span> <span m="1993000">in fact, we have three planes that are all passing through the</span> <span m="2000000">origin and all parallel to the same line.</span> <span m="2005000">And so that would be the line of solutions.</span> <span m="2008000">To find it actually we can think of this as follows.</span> <span m="2012000">The first observation is that actually in this situation we</span> <span m="2017000">don't need all three equations. The fact that the system has</span> <span m="2021000">infinitely many solutions means that actually one of the</span> <span m="2025000">equations is redundant. If you look at it long enough</span> <span m="2029000">you will see, for example,</span> <span m="2031000">if you multiply three times this equation and you subtract</span> <span m="2035000">that one then you will get the first equation.</span> <span m="2038000">Three times (x y) - (2x - z) will be x 3y z.</span> <span m="2045000">Now, we don't actually need to see that to solve a problem.</span> <span m="2048000">I am just showing you that is what happens when you have a</span> <span m="2050000">matrix with determinant zero. One of the equations is somehow</span> <span m="2054000">a duplicate of the others. We don't actually need to</span> <span m="2059000">figure out how exactly. What that means is really we</span> <span m="2064000">want to solve, let's say start with two of the</span> <span m="2068000">equations. To find the solution we can</span> <span m="2073000">observe that the first equation says actually that </span> <span m="2081000">y, z&gt; dot-product with</span> <span m="2086000">=0. And the second equation says</span> <span m="2092000">dot-product with &lt;2,0,- 1&gt; is zero.</span> <span m="2097000">And the third equation, if we really want to keep it,</span> <span m="2103000">says we should be also having this.</span> <span m="2108000">Now, these equations now written like this,</span> <span m="2111000">they are just saying we want an x, y, z that is perpendicular to</span> <span m="2115000">these vectors. Let's forget this one and let's</span> <span m="2119000">just look at these two. They are saying we want a</span> <span m="2123000">vector that is perpendicular to these two given vectors.</span> <span m="2127000">How do we find that? We do the cross-product.</span> <span m="2135000">To find x, y, z perpendicular to &lt;1,3,</span> <span m="2143000">1&gt; and &lt;2,0, - 1&gt;, we take the</span> <span m="2151000">cross-product. And that will give us</span> <span m="2156000">something. Well, let me just give you the</span> <span m="2158000">answer. I am sure you know how to do</span> <span m="2160000">cross-products by now. I don't have the answer here,</span> <span m="2167000">so I guess I have to do it. That should be &lt;- 3,</span> <span m="2178000">probably positive 3, and then - 6&gt;.</span> <span m="2186000">That is the solution. And any multiple of that is a</span> <span m="2189000">solution. If you like to neatly simplify</span> <span m="2191000">them you could say negative one, one, negative two.</span> <span m="2194000">If you like larger numbers you can multiply that by a million.</span> <span m="2197000">That is also a solution. Any questions about that?</span> <span m="2210000">Yes? That is correct.</span> <span m="2216000">If you pick these two guys instead, you will get the same</span> <span m="2220000">solution. Well, up to a multiple.</span> <span m="2222000">It could be if you do the cross-product of these two guys</span> <span m="2226000">you actually get something that is a multiple -- Actually,</span> <span m="2230000">I think if you do the cross-product of the first and</span> <span m="2234000">third one you will get actually minus one, one,</span> <span m="2237000">minus two, the smaller one. But it doesn't matter.</span> <span m="2240000">I mean it is really in the same direction.</span> <span m="2242000">This is all because a plane has actually normal vectors of all</span> <span m="2247000">sizes. Yes?</span> <span m="2252000">I don't think so because -- An important thing to remember</span> <span m="2255000">about cross-product is we compute for minors,</span> <span m="2258000">but then we put a minus sign on the second component.</span> <span m="2260000">The coefficient of j in here, the second component,</span> <span m="2264000">you do one times minus two times one.</span> <span m="2267000">That is negative three indeed. But then you actually change</span> <span m="2271000">that to a positive three. Yes?</span> <span m="2294000">Well, we don't have parametric equations here.</span> <span m="2301000">Oh, solving by elimination. Well, if it says that you have</span> <span m="2305000">to use vector methods then you should use vector methods.</span> <span m="2309000">If it says you should use vectors and matrices then you</span> <span m="2312000">are expected to do it that way. Yes?</span> <span m="2321000">It depends what the problem is asking.</span> <span m="2323000">The question is, is it enough to find the</span> <span m="2325000">components of a vector or do we have to find the equation of a</span> <span m="2327000">line? Here it says find one solution</span> <span m="2330000">using vector operations. We have found one solution.</span> <span m="2335000">If you wanted to find the line then it would all the things</span> <span m="2338000">that are proportional to this. It would be maybe minus 3t,</span> <span m="2344000">3t minus 6t, all the multiples of that</span> <span m="2349000">vector. We do because (0,0,</span> <span m="2352000">0) is an obvious solution. Maybe I should write that on</span> <span m="2357000">the board. You had another question?</span> <span m="2368000">Not quite. Let me re-explain first how we</span> <span m="2371000">get all the solutions and why I did that cross-product.</span> <span m="2408000">First of all, why did I take that</span> <span m="2409000">cross-product again? I took that cross-product</span> <span m="2412000">because I looked at my three equations and I observed that my</span> <span m="2417000">three equations can be reformulated in terms of these</span> <span m="2421000">dot-products saying that x, y, z is actually perpendicular</span> <span m="2425000">these guys and these guys have normal vectors to the planes.</span> <span m="2429000">Remember, to be in all three planes it has to be</span> <span m="2433000">perpendicular to the normal vectors.</span> <span m="2436000">That is how we got here. And now, if we want something</span> <span m="2440000">that is perpendicular to a bunch of given vectors,</span> <span m="2443000">well, to be perpendicular to two vectors,</span> <span m="2445000">an easy way to find one is to take that cross-product.</span> <span m="2448000">And, if you take any two of them, you will get something</span> <span m="2451000">that is the same up to scaling. Now, what it means</span> <span m="2454000">geometrically is that when we have our three planes and they</span> <span m="2460000">all actually contain the same line -- And we know that is</span> <span m="2466000">actually the smae case because they all pass through the</span> <span m="2471000">origin. They pass through the origin</span> <span m="2476000">because the constant terms are just zero.</span> <span m="2480000">What happens is that the normal vectors to these planes are,</span> <span m="2486000">in fact, all perpendicular to that line.</span> <span m="2489000">The normal vectors -- Say this line is vertical.</span> <span m="2500000">The normal vectors are all going to be horizontal.</span> <span m="2505000">Well, it is kind of hard to draw.</span> <span m="2509000">By taking the cross-product between two normal vectors we</span> <span m="2513000">found this direction. Now, to find actually all the</span> <span m="2521000">solutions. What we know so far is that we</span> <span m="2526000">have this direction &lt;-3 3 - 6&gt;.</span> <span m="2531000">That is going to be parallel to the line of intersections.</span> <span m="2534000">Let me do it here, for example,</span> <span m="2539000">. Now we have one particular</span> <span m="2549000">solution. 0,0, 0.</span> <span m="2554000">Actually, we have found another one, too, which is &lt;- 3,3,</span> <span m="2559000">- 6&gt;. Anyway, if a line of solutions</span> <span m="2566000">-- -- has parametric equation x = - 3t, y = 3t,</span> <span m="2575000">z = - 6t, anything proportional to that.</span> <span m="2584000">That is how we would find all the solutions if we wanted them.</span> <span m="2598000">It is almost time. I think I need to jump ahead to</span> <span m="2602000">other problems. Let's see.</span> <span m="2604000">I think problem 4 you can probably find for yourselves.</span> <span m="2609000">It is a reasonably straightforward parametric</span> <span m="2612000">equation problem. You just have to find the</span> <span m="2615000">coordinates of point P. And for that it is a very</span> <span m="2619000">simple trick. Problem 5.</span> <span m="2621000">Find the area of a spaced triangle.</span> <span m="2623000">It sounds like a cross-product. Find the equation of a plane</span> <span m="2627000">also sounds like a cross-product.</span> <span m="2630000">And find the intersection of this plane with a line means we</span> <span m="2633000">find first the parametric equation of the line and then we</span> <span m="2636000">plug that into the equation of the plane to get where they</span> <span m="2639000">intersect. Does that sound reasonable?</span> <span m="2642000">Who is disparate about problem 5?</span> <span m="2646000">OK. Let me repeat problem 5. First part we need to find the</span> <span m="2655000">area of a triangle. And the way to do that is to</span> <span m="2659000">just do one-half the length of a cross-product.</span> <span m="2662000">If we have three points, P0, P1, P2 then maybe we can</span> <span m="2672000">form vectors P0P1 and P0P2. And, if we take that</span> <span m="2678000">cross-product and take the length of that and divide by</span> <span m="2682000">two, that will give us the area of a triangle.</span> <span m="2686000">Here it turns out that this guy is ,</span> <span m="2692000">if I look at the solutions, so you will end up with square</span> <span m="2699000">root of 6 over 2. The second is asking you for</span> <span m="2706000">the equation of a plane containing these three points.</span> <span m="2713000">Well, first of all, we know that a normal vector to</span> <span m="2723000">the plane is going to be given by this cross-product again.</span> <span m="2734000">That means that the equation of plane will be of a form x plus y</span> <span m="2740000">plus 2z equals something. If a coefficient is here it</span> <span m="2745000">comes from the normal vector. And to find what goes in the</span> <span m="2749000">right-hand side, we just plug in any of the</span> <span m="2751000">points. If you plug in P0,</span> <span m="2755000">which is (2,1, 0) then two plus one seems like</span> <span m="2763000">it is 3. And, if you want to</span> <span m="2766000">double-check your answer, you can take P1 and P2 and</span> <span m="2768000">check that you also get three. It is a good way to check your</span> <span m="2775000">answer. Then the third part.</span> <span m="2778000">We have a line parallel to the vector v equals one,</span> <span m="2785000">one, one through the point S, which is (- 1,0,</span> <span m="2791000">0). That means you can find its</span> <span m="2794000">parametric equation. X will start at - 1,</span> <span m="2797000">increases at rate 1. Y starts at zero,</span> <span m="2801000">increases at rate one. Z starts at zero,</span> <span m="2804000">increases at rate one. You plug these into the plane</span> <span m="2808000">equation, and that will tell you where they intersect.</span> <span m="2812000">Is that clear? And now, in the last one</span> <span m="2818000">minute, on that side I have one minute,</span> <span m="2823000">let me just say very quickly -- Well,</span> <span m="2828000">do you want to hear about problem 6 anyway very quickly?</span> <span m="2830000">Yeah. OK. Problem 6 is one of these like</span> <span m="2840000">vector calculations. It says we have a position</span> <span m="2844000">vector R. And it asks you how do we find</span> <span m="2848000">the derivative of R dot R? Well, remember we have a</span> <span m="2852000">product rule for taking the derivative.</span> <span m="2854000">UV prime is U prime V plus UV prime.</span> <span m="2857000">It also applies for dot-product. That is dR by dt dot R plus R</span> <span m="2864000">dot dR by dt. And these are both the same</span> <span m="2869000">thing. You get two R dot dR/dt,</span> <span m="2872000">but dR/dt is v for velocity vector.</span> <span m="2877000">Hopefully you have seen things like that.</span> <span m="2880000">Now, it says show that if R has constant length then they are</span> <span m="2884000">perpendicular. All you need to write basically</span> <span m="2890000">is we assume length R is constant.</span> <span m="2895000">That is what it says, R has constant length.</span> <span m="2898000">Well, how do we get to, say, something we probably want</span> <span m="2901000">to reduce to that? Well, if R is constant in</span> <span m="2906000">length then R dot R is also constant.</span> <span m="2912000">And so that means d by dt of R dot R is zero.</span> <span m="2919000">That is what it means to be constant.</span> <span m="2921000">And so that means R dot v is zero.</span> <span m="2926000">That means R is perpendicular to v.</span> <span m="2932000">That is a proof. It is not a scary proof.</span> <span m="2938000">And then the last question of the exam says let's continue to</span> <span m="2944000">assume that R has constant length, and let's try to find R</span> <span m="2950000">dot v. If there is acceleration then</span> <span m="2953000">probably we should bring it in somewhere, maybe by taking a</span> <span m="2957000">derivative of something. If we know that R dot v equals</span> <span m="2961000">zero, let's take the derivative of that.</span> <span m="2964000">That is still zero. But now, using the product</span> <span m="2972000">rule, dR/dt is v dot v plus R dot dv/dt is going to be zero.</span> <span m="2980000">That means that you are asked about R dot A.</span> <span m="2983000">Well, that is equal to minus V dot V.</span> <span m="2988000">And that is it.</span> </p>

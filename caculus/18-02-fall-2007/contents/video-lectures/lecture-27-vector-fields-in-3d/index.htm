And so, in particular,</span> <span m="52000">we will be learning about flux and work.</span> <span m="55000">So, just for a change, we will be starting with flux</span> <span m="58000">first. And we will do work,</span> <span m="60000">actually, after Thanksgiving. Just to remind you,</span> <span m="64000">a vector field in space is just the same thing as in the plane.</span> <span m="68000">At every point you have a vector, and the components of</span> <span m="79000">this vector depend on the coordinates x,</span> <span m="86000">y and z. Let's say the components might</span> <span m="94000">be P, Q, R, or your favorite three letters,</span> <span m="102000">where each of these things is a function of coordinates x,</span> <span m="113000">y, z. You have seen that in the plane</span> <span m="116000">it is already pretty hard to draw a vector field.</span> <span m="118000">Usually, in space, we won't really try too hard.</span> <span m="121000">But it is still useful to try to have a general idea for what</span> <span m="124000">the vectors in there are doing, whether they are all going in</span> <span m="127000">the same direction, whether they may be all</span> <span m="129000">vertical or horizontal, pointing away from the origin,</span> <span m="132000">towards it, things like that.</span> <span m="135000">But, generally-speaking, we won't really bother with</span> <span m="139000">trying to draw a picture because that is going to be quite hard.</span> <span m="144000">Just to give you examples, well, the same kinds of</span> <span m="150000">examples as the plane, you can think of force fields.</span> <span m="157000">For example, the gravitational attraction --</span> <span m="168000">-- of a solid mass, let's call this mass big M,</span> <span m="181000">at the origin on a mass M at point x, y, z.</span> <span m="193000">That would be given by a vector field that points toward the</span> <span m="200000">origin and whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the</span> <span m="207000">square of a distance from the origin.</span> <span m="211000">Such a field would be directed towards the origin and its</span> <span m="219000">magnitude would be of the order of a constant over pho squared</span> <span m="227000">where pho is the distance from the origin.</span> <span m="233000">The picture, if I really wanted to draw a</span> <span m="237000">picture, would be everywhere it is a field that points towards</span> <span m="242000">the origin. And if I am further away then</span> <span m="249000">it gets smaller. And, of course,</span> <span m="253000">I am not going to try to draw all these vectors in there.</span> <span m="256000">If I wanted to give a formula for that -- A formula for that</span> <span m="267000">might be something of a form minus c times x,</span> <span m="276000">y, z over pho cubed. Let's see.</span> <span m="281000">Well, the direction of this vector, this vector is</span> <span m="284000">proportional to negative x, y, z.</span> <span m="287000">is the vector that goes from the origin to your point.</span> <span m="289000">The negative goes towards the origin.</span> <span m="292000">Then the magnitude of this guy, well, the magnitude of x,</span> <span m="296000">y, z is just the distance from the origin rho.</span> <span m="300000">So the magnitude of this thing is one over rho cubed times some</span> <span m="305000">constant factor. That would be an example of a</span> <span m="310000">vector field that comes up in physics.</span> <span m="314000">Well, other examples would be electric fields.</span> <span m="320000">Actually, if you look at the electric field generated by a</span> <span m="323000">charged particle at the origin, it is given by exactly the same</span> <span m="327000">kind of formula, and there are magnetic fields</span> <span m="336000">and so on. Another example comes from</span> <span m="342000">velocity fields. If you have a fluid flow,</span> <span m="346000">for example, if you want to study wind</span> <span m="349000">patterns in the atmosphere. Well, wind, most of the time,</span> <span m="352000">is kind of horizontal, but maybe it depends on the</span> <span m="355000">altitude. At high altitude you have jet</span> <span m="358000">streams, and the wind velocity is not the same at all</span> <span m="363000">altitudes. And, just to give you more</span> <span m="368000">examples, in math we have seen that the gradient of a function</span> <span m="375000">of three variables gives you a vector field.</span> <span m="381000">If you have a function u of x, y, z then its gradient field</span> <span m="385000">has just components, u sub x, u sub y and u sub z.</span> <span m="390000">And, of course, the cases are not mutually</span> <span m="392000">exclusive. For example,</span> <span m="394000">the electric field or gravitational field is given by</span> <span m="398000">the gradient of the gravitational or electric</span> <span m="402000">potential. So, these are not like</span> <span m="406000">different cases. There is overlap.</span> <span m="411000">Anyway, hopefully, you are kind of convinced that</span> <span m="414000">you should learn about vector fields.</span> <span m="417000">What are we going to do with them?</span> <span m="419000">Well, let's start with flux. Remember not so long ago we</span> <span m="436000">looked at flux of a two-dimensional field of a</span> <span m="444000">curve. We had a curve in the plane and</span> <span m="452000">we had a vector field. And we looked at the component</span> <span m="461000">of a vector field in the direction that was normal to the</span> <span m="467000">curve. We formed the flux integral</span> <span m="471000">that was a line integral F dot n ds.</span> <span m="474000">And that measured how much the vector field was going across</span> <span m="479000">the curve. If you were thinking of a</span> <span m="481000">velocity field, that would measure how much</span> <span m="485000">fluid is passing through the curve in unit time.</span> <span m="488000">Now let's say that we were in space.</span> <span m="490000">Well, we cannot really think of flux as a line integral.</span> <span m="494000">Because, if you have a curve in space and say that you have wind</span> <span m="498000">or something like that, you cannot really ask how much</span> <span m="502000">air is flowing through the curve.</span> <span m="504000">See, to have a flow through something you need a surface.</span> <span m="508000">If you have a net maybe then you can ask how much stuff is</span> <span m="512000">passing through that surface. There is going to be a big</span> <span m="517000">difference here. In the three-dimensional space,</span> <span m="524000">flux will be measured through a surface.</span> <span m="531000">And so it will be a surface integral, not a line integral</span> <span m="534000">anymore. That means we will be</span> <span m="539000">integrating, we will be summing over all the pieces of a surface</span> <span m="550000">in space. Because a surface is a</span> <span m="553000">two-dimensional object, that will end up being a double</span> <span m="555000">integral. But, of course,</span> <span m="557000">we will have to set it up properly because the surface</span> <span m="559000">that is in space, and we will probably have x,</span> <span m="562000">y and z to deal with at the same time,</span> <span m="564000">and we will have to somehow get rid of one variable so that we</span> <span m="568000">can set up and evaluate a double integral.</span> <span m="571000">So conceptually it is very similar to line integrals.</span> <span m="575000">In the line integral in the plane, you had two variables</span> <span m="579000">that you reduced to one by figuring out what the curve was.</span> <span m="582000">Here you have three variables that you will reduce to two by</span> <span m="591000">figuring out what the surface is.</span> <span m="596000">Let me give you a definition of flux in 3D.</span> <span m="600000">Let's say that we have a vector field and s, a surface in space.</span> <span m="615000">Let me draw some kind of a picture.</span> <span m="617000">I have my surface and I have my vector field F.</span> <span m="621000">Well, at every point it changes with a point.</span> <span m="625000">Well, I want to figure out how much my vector field is going</span> <span m="628000">across that surface. That means I want to figure out</span> <span m="634000">the normal component of my vector field,</span> <span m="640000">so I will use, as in the plane case,</span> <span m="645000">the unit normal vector to s. I take my point on the surface</span> <span m="653000">and build a unit vector that is standing on it perpendicularly.</span> <span m="659000">Now, we have to decide which way it is standing.</span> <span m="665000">We can build our normal vector to go this way or to go the</span> <span m="669000">other way around. There are two choices.</span> <span m="672000">Basically, whenever you want to set up a flux integral you have</span> <span m="676000">to choose one side of the surface.</span> <span m="679000">And you will count positively what flows toward that side and</span> <span m="683000">negatively what flows towards the other side.</span> <span m="686000">There are two choices for n. We need to choose a side of the</span> <span m="700000">surface. In the case of curves,</span> <span m="705000">we made that choice by deciding that because we were going along</span> <span m="710000">some direction on the curve we could choose one side by saying</span> <span m="714000">let's rotate clockwise from the tangent vector.</span> <span m="717000">And, in a way, what we were doing was really</span> <span m="720000">it was a recipe to choose for us one of the two sides.</span> <span m="724000">Here we don't have a notion of orienting the surface other than</span> <span m="729000">by precisely choosing one of the two possible normal vectors.</span> <span m="734000">So, in fact, this is called choosing an</span> <span m="735000">orientation of a surface. When you are saying you are</span> <span m="738000">orienting the surface that really means you are deciding</span> <span m="742000">which side is which. Let's call that orientation.</span> <span m="751000">Now, there is no set convention that will work forever.</span> <span m="755000">But the usually traditional settings would be to take your</span> <span m="759000">normal vector pointing maybe out of the solid region because then</span> <span m="763000">you will be looking at flux that is coming out of that region of</span> <span m="768000">space. Or, if you have a surface that</span> <span m="771000">is not like closed or anything but maybe you will want the flux</span> <span m="775000">going up through the region. Or, there are various</span> <span m="779000">conventions. Concretely, on problem sets it</span> <span m="782000">will either say which choice you have to make or you get to</span> <span m="785000">choose which one you want to make.</span> <span m="787000">And, of course, if you choose the other one</span> <span m="790000">then the sign becomes the opposite.</span> <span m="792000">Now, once we have made a choice then we can define the flux</span> <span m="797000">integral. It will just be the double</span> <span m="801000">integral over a surface of F dot n dS.</span> <span m="806000">Now I am using a big dS. That stands for the surface</span> <span m="813000">area element on this surface. I am using dS rather than dA</span> <span m="819000">because I still want to think of dA as maybe the area in one of</span> <span m="823000">the coordinate planes like the one we had in double integrals.</span> <span m="827000">You will see later where this comes in.</span> <span m="831000">But conceptually it is very similar.</span> <span m="834000">Concretely what this means is I cut my surface into little</span> <span m="839000">pieces. Each of them has area delta S.</span> <span m="843000">And, for each piece, I take my vector field,</span> <span m="847000">I take my normal vector, I dot them and I multiply by</span> <span m="853000">this surface area and sum all these things together.</span> <span m="857000">That is what a double integral means.</span> <span m="863000">In particular, an easy case where you know you</span> <span m="865000">can get away without computing anything is, of course,</span> <span m="868000">if your vector field is tangent to the surface because then you</span> <span m="872000">know that there is no flux. Flux is going to be zero</span> <span m="876000">because nothing passes through the surface.</span> <span m="878000">Otherwise, we have to figure out how to compute these things.</span> <span m="882000">That is what we are going to learn now.</span> <span m="890000">Well, maybe I should box this formula.</span> <span m="891000">I have noticed that some of you seem to like it when I box the</span> <span m="897000">important formulas. (APPLAUSE) By the way,</span> <span m="903000">a piece of notation before I move on, sometimes you will also</span> <span m="912000">see the notation vector dS. What is vector dS?</span> <span m="918000">Vector dS is this guy n dS put together.</span> <span m="924000">Vector dS is a vector which points perpendicular to the</span> <span m="930000">surface and whose length corresponds to the surface</span> <span m="935000">element. And the reason for having this</span> <span m="937000">shortcut notation, well, it is not only laziness</span> <span m="941000">like saving one n, but it is because this guy is</span> <span m="944000">very often easier to compute than it is to set up n and dS</span> <span m="949000">separately. Actually, if you remember in</span> <span m="952000">the plane, we have seen that vector n little ds can be</span> <span m="956000">written directly as dy, - dx.</span> <span m="959000">That was easier than finding n and ds separately.</span> <span m="963000">And here the same is going to be true in many cases.</span> <span m="975000">Well, any questions before we do examples?</span> <span m="983000">No. OK.</span> <span m="984000">Let's do examples. The first example for today is</span> <span m="998000">we are going to look at the flux of vector field xi yj xk through</span> <span m="1011000">the sphere of radius a -- -- centered at the origin.</span> <span m="1022000">What does the picture look like? We have a sphere of radius a.</span> <span m="1038000">I have my vector field. Well, , see,</span> <span m="1042000">that is a vector field that is equal to the vector from the</span> <span m="1045000">origin to the point where I am, so it is pointing radially away</span> <span m="1055000">from the origin. My vector field is really</span> <span m="1062000">sticking out everywhere away from the origin.</span> <span m="1069000">Now I have to find the normal vector to the sphere if I want</span> <span m="1076000">to set up double integral over the sphere of F dot vector ds,</span> <span m="1084000">or if you want F dot n dS. What does the normal vector to</span> <span m="1089000">the sphere look like? Well, it depends,</span> <span m="1092000">of course, whether I choose it pointing out or in.</span> <span m="1094000">Let's say I am choosing it pointing out then it will be</span> <span m="1098000">sticking straight out of a sphere as well.</span> <span m="1100000">Hopefully, you can see that if I take a normal vector to the</span> <span m="1107000">sphere it is actually pointing radially out away from the</span> <span m="1114000">origin. In fact, our vector field and</span> <span m="1118000">our normal vector are parallel to each other.</span> <span m="1121000">Let's think a bit more about what a normal vector looks like.</span> <span m="1125000">I said it is sticking straight out.</span> <span m="1127000">It is proportional to this vector field.</span> <span m="1129000">Maybe I should start by writing</span> <span m="1132000">because that is the vector that goes from the origin to my point</span> <span m="1136000">so it points radially away from the origin.</span> <span m="1139000">Now there is a small problem with that.</span> <span m="1140000">It is not a unit vector. So what is its length?</span> <span m="1144000">Well, its length is square root of x^2 y^2 z^2.</span> <span m="1148000">But, if I am on the sphere, then that length is just equal</span> <span m="1153000">to a because distance from the origin is a.</span> <span m="1156000">In fact, I get my normal vector by scaling this guy down by a</span> <span m="1163000">factor of a. And let me write it down just</span> <span m="1167000">in case you are still unsure. This is unit because square</span> <span m="1174000">root of x^2 y^2 z^2 is equal to a on the sphere.</span> <span m="1183000">OK. Any questions about this?</span> <span m="1188000">No. It looks OK? I see a lot of blank faces.</span> <span m="1192000">That physics test must have been hard.</span> <span m="1198000">Yes? I could have put a rho but I</span> <span m="1203000">want to emphasize the fact that here it is going to be a</span> <span m="1206000">constant. I mean rho has this connotation</span> <span m="1209000">of being a variable that I will need to then maybe integrate</span> <span m="1213000">over or do something with. Yes, it would be correct to put</span> <span m="1217000">rho but I then later will want to replace it by its actual</span> <span m="1220000">value which is a number. And the number is a.</span> <span m="1224000">It is not going to actually change from point to point.</span> <span m="1228000">For example, if this was the unit sphere</span> <span m="1230000">then I would just put x, y, z.</span> <span m="1232000">I wouldn't divide by anything. Now let's figure out F dot n.</span> <span m="1241000">Let's do things one at a time. Well, F and n are parallel to</span> <span m="1247000">each other. F dot n, the normal component</span> <span m="1253000">of F, is actually equal to the length of F.</span> <span m="1260000">Well, times the length of n if you want, but that is going to</span> <span m="1265000">be a one since F and n are parallel to each other.</span> <span m="1269000">And what is the magnitude of F if I am on the sphere?</span> <span m="1272000">Well, the magnitude of F in general is square root of x^2</span> <span m="1278000">y^2 z^2 on the sphere that is going be a.</span> <span m="1283000">The other way to do it, if you don't want to think</span> <span m="1285000">geometrically like that, is to just to do the dot</span> <span m="1288000">product x, y, z doted with x over a,</span> <span m="1291000">y over a, z over a. You will be x^2 y^2 z^2 divided</span> <span m="1295000">by a. That will simplify to a because</span> <span m="1300000">we are on the sphere. See, we are already using here</span> <span m="1305000">the relation between x, y and z.</span> <span m="1307000">We are not letting x, y and z be completely</span> <span m="1309000">arbitrary. But the slogan is everything</span> <span m="1311000">happens on the surface where we are doing the integral.</span> <span m="1314000">We are not looking at anything inside or outside.</span> <span m="1316000">We are just on the surface.</span> <span m="1354000">Now what do I do with that? Well, I have turned my integral</span> <span m="1363000">into the double integral of a dS.</span> <span m="1370000">And a is just a constant, so I am very lucky here.</span> <span m="1373000">I can just say this will be a times the double integral of dS.</span> <span m="1379000">And, of course, some day I will have to learn</span> <span m="1382000">how to tackle that beast, but for now I don't actually</span> <span m="1385000">need to because the double integral of dS just means I am</span> <span m="1388000">summing the area of each little piece of the sphere.</span> <span m="1391000">I am just going to get the total area of the sphere which I</span> <span m="1396000">know to be 4pi a2. This guy here is going to be</span> <span m="1403000">the area of S. I know that to be 4pi a^2.</span> <span m="1409000">So I will get 4pi a^3. That one was relatively</span> <span m="1417000">painless. That was too easy.</span> <span m="1424000">Let's do a second example with the same sphere.</span> <span m="1429000">But now my vector field is going to be just z times k.</span> <span m="1436000">Well, let me give it a different name.</span> <span m="1438000">Let me call it H instead of f or something like that just so</span> <span m="1444000">that it is not called F anymore. Well, the initial part of the</span> <span m="1448000">setup is still the same. The normal vector is still the</span> <span m="1451000">same. What changes is,</span> <span m="1453000">of course, my vector field is no longer sticking straight out</span> <span m="1456000">so I cannot use this easy geometric argument.</span> <span m="1458000">It looks like I will have to compute F dot n and then figure</span> <span m="1462000">out how to integrate that with dS.</span> <span m="1464000">Let's do that. We still have that n is </span> <span m="1476000">y, z&gt;/a. That tells us that H dot n will</span> <span m="1484000">be dot </span> <span m="1489000">z&gt; / a. It looks like I will be left</span> <span m="1497000">with z^2 over a. H dot n is z^2 over a.</span> <span m="1510000">The double integral for flux now becomes double integral on</span> <span m="1518000">the sphere of z^2 over a dS. Well, we can take out one over</span> <span m="1525000">a, that is fine, but it looks like we will have</span> <span m="1529000">to integrate z^2 on the surface of the sphere.</span> <span m="1533000">How do we do that? Well, we have to figure out</span> <span m="1537000">what is dS in terms of our favorite set of two variables</span> <span m="1541000">that we will use to integrate. Now, what is the best way to</span> <span m="1545000">figure out where you are on the sphere?</span> <span m="1547000">Well, you could try to use maybe theta and z.</span> <span m="1551000">If you know how high you are and where you are around,</span> <span m="1555000">in principle you know where you are on the sphere.</span> <span m="1558000">But since spherical coordinates we have actually learned about</span> <span m="1562000">something much more interesting, namely spherical coordinates.</span> <span m="1566000">It looks like longitude / latitude is the way to go when</span> <span m="1569000">trying to figure out where you are on a sphere.</span> <span m="1572000">We are going to use phi and theta.</span> <span m="1579000">And, of course, we have to figure out how to</span> <span m="1584000">express dS in terms of d phi and d theta.</span> <span m="1588000">Well, if you were paying really, really close attention</span> <span m="1592000">last time, you will notice that we have actually already done</span> <span m="1596000">that. Last time we saw that if I have</span> <span m="1601000">a sphere of radius a and I take a little piece of it that</span> <span m="1608000">corresponds to small changes in phi and theta then we said that</span> <span m="1616000">-- Well, we argued that this side here,</span> <span m="1621000">the one that is going east-west was a piece of the circle that</span> <span m="1628000">has a radius a sin phi because that is r,</span> <span m="1634000">so that side is a sin phi delta theta.</span> <span m="1639000">And the side that goes north-south is a piece of the</span> <span m="1642000">circle of radius a corresponding to angle delta phi,</span> <span m="1646000">so it is a delta phi. And so, just to get to the</span> <span m="1652000">answer, we got dS equals a^2 sin phi d phi d theta.</span> <span m="1660000">When we set up a surface integral on the surface of a</span> <span m="1665000">sphere, most likely we will be using</span> <span m="1668000">phi and theta as our two variables of integration and dS</span> <span m="1672000">will become this. Now, it is OK to think of them</span> <span m="1675000">as spherical coordinates, but I would like to encourage</span> <span m="1678000">you not to think of them as spherical coordinates.</span> <span m="1681000">Spherical coordinates are a way of describing points in space in</span> <span m="1685000">terms of three variables. Here it is more like we are</span> <span m="1689000">parameterizing the sphere. We are finding a parametric</span> <span m="1692000">equation for the sphere using two variables phi and theta</span> <span m="1695000">which happen to be part of the spherical coordinate system.</span> <span m="1698000">But, see, there is no rho involved in here.</span> <span m="1702000">I am not using any rho ever, and I am not going to in this</span> <span m="1706000">calculation. I have two variable phi and</span> <span m="1708000">theta. That is it.</span> <span m="1717000">It is basically in the same way as when you parameterize a line</span> <span m="1720000">integral in the circle, we use theta as the parameter</span> <span m="1725000">variable and never think about r.</span> <span m="1730000">That being said, well, we are going to use phi</span> <span m="1732000">and theta. We know what dS is.</span> <span m="1734000">We still need to figure out what z is.</span> <span m="1738000">There we want to think a tiny bit about spherical coordinates</span> <span m="1741000">again. And we will know that z is just</span> <span m="1748000">a cos phi. In case you don't quite see it,</span> <span m="1755000">let me draw a diagram. Phi is the angle down from the</span> <span m="1765000">positive z axes, this distance is a,</span> <span m="1771000">so this distance here is a cos phi.</span> <span m="1778000">Now I have everything I need to compute my double integral.</span> <span m="1784000">z^2 over a dS will become a double integral.</span> <span m="1789000">z^2 becomes a^2 cos^2 phi over a times, ds becomes,</span> <span m="1800000">a^2 sin phi d phi d theta. Now I need to set up bounds.</span> <span m="1807000">Well, what are the bounds? Phi goes all the way from zero</span> <span m="1812000">to pi because we go all the way from the north pole to the south</span> <span m="1819000">pole, and theta goes from zero to 2pi.</span> <span m="1823000">And, of course, I can get rid of some a's in</span> <span m="1827000">there and take them out. Let's look at what number we</span> <span m="1834000">get. First of all,</span> <span m="1837000">we can take out all those a's and get a^3.</span> <span m="1843000">Second, in the inner integral, we are integrating cos^2 phi</span> <span m="1850000">sin phi d phi. I claim that integrates to cos3</span> <span m="1854000">up to some factor, and that factor should be</span> <span m="1857000">negative one-third. If you look at cos3 phi and you</span> <span m="1862000">take its derivative, you will get that guy with a</span> <span m="1867000">negative three in front between zero and pi.</span> <span m="1872000">And, while integrating over theta, we will just multiply</span> <span m="1876000">things by 2pi. Let me add the 2pi in front.</span> <span m="1884000">Now, if I evaluate this guy between zero and pi,</span> <span m="1887000">well, at pi cos^3 is negative one, at zero it is one,</span> <span m="1892000">I will get two-thirds out of this.</span> <span m="1895000">I end up with four-thirds pi a^3.</span> <span m="1899000">Sorry I didn't write very much because I am trying to save</span> <span m="1906000">blackboard space. Yes?</span> <span m="1912000">That is a very natural question. That looks a lot like somebody</span> <span m="1915000">we know, like the volume of a sphere.</span> <span m="1918000">And ultimately it will be. Wait until next class when we</span> <span m="1923000">talk about the divergence theorem.</span> <span m="1927000">I mean the question was is this related to the volume of a</span> <span m="1931000">sphere, and ultimately it is, but for now it is just some</span> <span m="1934000">coincidence. Yes?</span> <span m="1943000">The question is there is a way to do it M dx plus N dy plus</span> <span m="1946000">stuff like that? The answer is unfortunately no</span> <span m="1948000">because it is not a line integral.</span> <span m="1950000">It is a surface integral, so we need to have to variables</span> <span m="1955000">in there. In a way you would end up with</span> <span m="1958000">things like some dx dy maybe and so on.</span> <span m="1961000">I mean it is not practical to do it directly that way because</span> <span m="1965000">you would have then to compute Jacobians to switch from dx dy</span> <span m="1969000">to something else. We are going to see various</span> <span m="1972000">ways of computing it. Unfortunately,</span> <span m="1974000">it is not quite as simple as with line integrals.</span> <span m="1977000">But it is not much harder. It is the same spirit.</span> <span m="1979000">We just use two variables and set up everything in terms of</span> <span m="1984000">these two variables. Any other questions?</span> <span m="1992000">No. OK.</span> <span m="2031000">By the way, just some food for thought.</span> <span m="2034000">Never mind. Conclusion of looking at these</span> <span m="2041000">two examples is that sometimes we can use geometric.</span> <span m="2045000">The first example, we didn't actually have to</span> <span m="2047000">compute an integral. But most of the time we need to</span> <span m="2051000">learn how to set up double integrals.</span> <span m="2054000">Use geometry or you need to set up for double integral of a</span> <span m="2066000">surface. And so we are going to learn</span> <span m="2070000">how to do that in general. As I said, we need to have two</span> <span m="2073000">parameters on the surface and express everything in terms of</span> <span m="2077000">these. Let's look at various examples.</span> <span m="2083000">We are going to see various situations where we can do</span> <span m="2086000">things. Well, let's start with an easy</span> <span m="2089000">one. Let's call that number zero.</span> <span m="2093000">Say that my surface S is a horizontal plane,</span> <span m="2102000">say z equals a. When I say a horizontal plane,</span> <span m="2107000">it doesn't have to be the entire horizontal plane.</span> <span m="2109000">It could be a small piece of it. It could even be,</span> <span m="2114000">to trick you, maybe an ellipse in there or a</span> <span m="2116000">triangle in there or something like that.</span> <span m="2119000">What you have to recognize is my surface is a piece of just a</span> <span m="2123000">flat plane, so I shouldn't worry too much about what part of a</span> <span m="2127000">plane it is. Well, it will become important</span> <span m="2130000">when I set up bounds for integration.</span> <span m="2132000">But, when it comes to looking for the normal vector,</span> <span m="2136000">be rest assured that the normal vector to a horizontal plane is</span> <span m="2140000">just vertical. It is going to be either k or</span> <span m="2144000">negative k depending on whether I have chosen to orient it</span> <span m="2149000">pointing up or down. And which one I choose might</span> <span m="2154000">depend on what I am going to try to do.</span> <span m="2157000">The normal vector is just sticking straight up or straight</span> <span m="2162000">down. Now, what about dS?</span> <span m="2165000">Well, it is just going to be the area element in a horizontal</span> <span m="2171000">plane. It just looks like it should be</span> <span m="2174000">dx dy. I mean if I am moving on a</span> <span m="2176000">horizontal plane, to know where I am,</span> <span m="2178000">I should know x and y. So dS will be dx dy.</span> <span m="2186000">If I play the game that way, I have my vector field F.</span> <span m="2191000">I do F dot n. That just gives me the z</span> <span m="2194000">component which might involve x, y and z.</span> <span m="2197000">x and y I am very happy with. They will stay as my variables.</span> <span m="2200000">Whenever I see z, well, I want to get rid of it.</span> <span m="2203000">That is easy because z is just equal to a.</span> <span m="2206000">I just plug that value and I am left with only x and y,</span> <span m="2210000">and I am integrating that dx dy.</span> <span m="2213000">It is actually ending up being just a usual double integral in</span> <span m="2218000">x, y coordinates. And, of course,</span> <span m="2220000">once it is set up anything is fair game.</span> <span m="2222000">I might want to switch to polar coordinates or something like</span> <span m="2225000">that. Or, I can set it up dx dy or dy</span> <span m="2229000">dx. All the usual stuff applies.</span> <span m="2232000">But, for the initial setup, we are just going to use these</span> <span m="2237000">and express everything in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="2241000">A small variation on that. Let's say that we take vertical</span> <span m="2247000">planes that are parallel to maybe the blackboard plane,</span> <span m="2255000">so parallel to the yz plane. That might be something like x</span> <span m="2262000">equals some constant. Well, what would I do then?</span> <span m="2267000">It could be pretty much the same.</span> <span m="2272000">The normal vector for this guy would be sticking straight out</span> <span m="2275000">towards me or away from me. Let's say I am having it come</span> <span m="2279000">to the front. The normal vector would be</span> <span m="2283000">plus/minus i. And the variables that I would</span> <span m="2287000">be using, to find out my position on this guy,</span> <span m="2291000">would be y and z. In terms of those,</span> <span m="2294000">the surface element is just dy dz.</span> <span m="2299000">Similarly for planes parallel to the xz plane.</span> <span m="2305000">You can figure that one out. These are somehow the easiest</span> <span m="2313000">ones, because those we already know how to compute without too</span> <span m="2319000">much trouble. What if it is a more</span> <span m="2321000">complicated plane? We will come back to that next</span> <span m="2323000">time. Let's explore some other</span> <span m="2329000">situations first. Number one on the list.</span> <span m="2336000">Let's say that I gave you a sphere of radius a centered at</span> <span m="2343000">the origin, or maybe just half of that sphere or some portion</span> <span m="2349000">of it. Well, we have already seen how</span> <span m="2352000">to do things. Namely, we will be saying the</span> <span m="2355000">normal vector is x, y, z over a,</span> <span m="2358000">plus or minus depending on whether we want it pointing in</span> <span m="2363000">or out. And dS will be a^2 sin phi d</span> <span m="2369000">phi d theta. In fact, we will express</span> <span m="2372000">everything in terms of phi and theta.</span> <span m="2375000">If I wanted to I could tell you what the formulas are for x,</span> <span m="2377000">y, z in terms of phi and theta. You know them.</span> <span m="2380000">But it is actually better to wait a little bit.</span> <span m="2384000">It is better to do F dot n, because F is also going to have</span> <span m="2388000">a bunch of x's, y's and z's.</span> <span m="2389000">And if there is any kind of symmetry to the problem then you</span> <span m="2393000">might end up with things like x^2 y^2 z^2 or things that have</span> <span m="2397000">more symmetry that are easier to express in terms of phi and</span> <span m="2401000">theta. The advice would be first do</span> <span m="2405000">the dot product with F, and then see what you get and</span> <span m="2410000">then turn it into phi and theta. That is one we have seen.</span> <span m="2417000">Let's say that I have -- It is a close cousin.</span> <span m="2420000">Let's say I have a cylinder of radius a centered on the z-axis.</span> <span m="2430000">What does that look like? And, again, when I say</span> <span m="2437000">cylinder, it could be a piece of cylinder.</span> <span m="2440000">First of all, what does the normal vector to</span> <span m="2444000">a cylinder look like? Well, it is sticking straight</span> <span m="2447000">out, but sticking straight out in a slightly different way from</span> <span m="2450000">what happens with a sphere. See, the sides of a cylinder</span> <span m="2452000">are vertical. If you imagine that you have</span> <span m="2454000">this big cylindrical type in front of you,</span> <span m="2456000">hopefully you can see that a normal vector is going to always</span> <span m="2459000">be horizontal. It is sticking straight out in</span> <span m="2462000">the horizontal directions. It doesn't have any z component.</span> <span m="2467000">I claim the normal vector for the cylinder,</span> <span m="2473000">if you have a point here at (x, y, z), it would be pointing</span> <span m="2481000">straight out away from the central axis.</span> <span m="2487000">My normal vector, well, if I am taking it two</span> <span m="2491000">points outwards, will be going straight away</span> <span m="2494000">from the central axis. If I look at it from above,</span> <span m="2498000">maybe it is easier if I look at it from above,</span> <span m="2502000">look at x, y, then my cylinder looks like a</span> <span m="2505000">circle and the normal vector just points straight out.</span> <span m="2509000">It is the same situation as when we had a circle in the 2D</span> <span m="2513000">case. The normal vector for that is</span> <span m="2517000">just going to be x, y and 0 in the z component.</span> <span m="2522000">Well, plus/minus, depending on whether you want</span> <span m="2525000">it sticking in or out.</span> <span m="2561000">We said in our cylinder normal vector is plus or minus x,</span> <span m="2567000">y, zero over a. What about the surface element?</span> <span m="2574000">Before we ask that, maybe we should first figure</span> <span m="2577000">out what coordinates are we going to use to locate ourselves</span> <span m="2580000">in a cylinder. Well, yes,</span> <span m="2582000">we probably want to use part of a cylindrical coordinate,</span> <span m="2585000">except for, well, we don't want r because r</span> <span m="2588000">doesn't change, it is not a variable here.</span> <span m="2591000">Indeed, you probably want to use z to tell how high you are</span> <span m="2595000">and theta to tell you where you are around.</span> <span m="2598000">dS should be in terms of dz d theta.</span> <span m="2607000">Now, what is the constant? Well, let's look at a small</span> <span m="2613000">piece of our cylinder corresponding to a small angle</span> <span m="2619000">delta theta and a small height delta z.</span> <span m="2624000">Well, the height, as I said, is going to be delta</span> <span m="2627000">z. What about the width?</span> <span m="2630000">It is going to be a piece of a circle of radius a corresponding</span> <span m="2635000">to the angle delta theta, so this side will be a delta</span> <span m="2639000">theta. Delta S is a delta theta delta</span> <span m="2645000">z. DS is just a dz d theta or d</span> <span m="2648000">theta dz. It doesn't matter which way you</span> <span m="2653000">do it. And so when we set up the flux</span> <span m="2656000">integral, we will take first the dot product of f with this</span> <span m="2661000">normal vector. Then we will stick in this dS.</span> <span m="2665000">And then, of course, we will get rid of any x and y</span> <span m="2668000">that are left by expressing them in terms of theta.</span> <span m="2671000">Maybe x becomes a cos theta, y becomes a sin theta.</span> <span m="2677000">These various formulas, you should try to remember them</span> <span m="2681000">because they are really useful, for the sphere,</span> <span m="2685000">for the cylinder. And, hopefully,</span> <span m="2688000">those for the planes you kind of know already intuitively.</span> <span m="2692000">What about marginals or faces? Not everything in life is made</span> <span m="2699000">out of cylinders and spheres. I mean it is a good try.</span> <span m="2708000">Let's look at a marginal kind of surface.</span> <span m="2711000">Let's say I give you a graph of a function z equals f of x,</span> <span m="2719000">y. This guy has nothing to do with</span> <span m="2721000">the integrand. It is not what we are</span> <span m="2722000">integrating. We are just integrating a</span> <span m="2724000">vector field that has nothing to do with that.</span> <span m="2726000">This is how I want to describe the surface on which I will be</span> <span m="2731000">integrating. My surface is given by z as a</span> <span m="2737000">function of x, y.</span> <span m="2740000">Well, I would need to tell you what n is and what dS is.</span> <span m="2748000">That is going to be slightly annoying.</span> <span m="2751000">I mean, I don't want to tell them separately because you see</span> <span m="2754000">they are pretty hard. Instead, I am going to tell you</span> <span m="2758000">that in this case, well, let's see.</span> <span m="2761000">What variables do we want? I am going to tell you a</span> <span m="2767000">formula for n dS. What variables do we want to</span> <span m="2771000">express this in terms of? Well, most likely x and y</span> <span m="2775000">because we know how to express z in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="2779000">This is an invitation to get rid of any z that might be left</span> <span m="2786000">and set everything up in terms of dx dy.</span> <span m="2790000">The formula that we are going to see,</span> <span m="2791000">I think we are going to see the details of why it works</span> <span m="2796000">tomorrow, is that you can take negative</span> <span m="2800000">partial f partial x, negative partial f partial y,</span> <span m="2804000">one, dx dy.</span> <span m="2808000">Plus/minus depending on which way you want it to go.</span> <span m="2812000">If you really want to know what dS is, well, dS is the magnitude</span> <span m="2817000">of this vector times dx dy. There will be a square root and</span> <span m="2821000">some squares and some stuff. What is the normal vector?</span> <span m="2824000">Well, you take this vector and you scale it down to unit</span> <span m="2830000">length. Just to emphasize it,</span> <span m="2834000">this guy here is not n and this guy here is not dS.</span> <span m="2844000">Each of them is more complicated than that,</span> <span m="2847000">but the combination somehow simplifies nicely.</span> <span m="2851000">And that is good news for us. Now, concretely,</span> <span m="2856000">one way you can think about it is this tells you how to reduce</span> <span m="2860000">things to an integral of x and y.</span> <span m="2862000">And, of course, you will have to figure out</span> <span m="2864000">what are the bounds on x and y. That means you will need to</span> <span m="2867000">know what does the shadow of your surface look like in the x,</span> <span m="2871000">y plane. To set up bounds on whatever</span> <span m="2879000">you will get dx dy, well, of course you can switch</span> <span m="2886000">to dy dx or anything you would like,</span> <span m="2888000">but you will need to look at the shadow of S in the x y</span> <span m="2899000">plane. But only do that after you</span> <span m="2902000">gotten rid of all the z. When you no longer have z then</span> <span m="2907000">you can figure out what the bounds are for x and y.</span> <span m="2913000">Any questions about that? Yes?</span> <span m="2920000">For the cylinder. OK.</span> <span m="2922000">Let me re-explain quickly how I got a normal vector for the</span> <span m="2924000">cylinder. If you know what a cylinder</span> <span m="2927000">looks like, you probably can see that the normal vector sticks</span> <span m="2930000">straight out of it horizontally. That means the z component of n</span> <span m="2936000">is going to be zero. And then the x,</span> <span m="2939000">y components you get by looking at it from above.</span> <span m="2942000">One last thing I want to say. What about the geometric</span> <span m="2952000">interpretation and how to prove it?</span> <span m="2955000">Well, if your vector field F is a velocity field then the flux</span> <span m="2967000">is the amount of matter that crosses the surface that passes</span> <span m="2977000">through S per unit time. And the way that you would</span> <span m="2984000">prove it would be similar to the picture that I drew when we did</span> <span m="2987000">it in the plane. Namely, you would consider a</span> <span m="2990000">small element of a surface delta S.</span> <span m="2993000">And you would try to figure out what is the stuff that flows</span> <span m="2995000">through it in a second. Well, it is the stuff that</span> <span m="2999000">lives in a small box whose base is that piece of surface and</span> <span m="3005000">whose other side is given by the vector field.</span> <span m="3010000">And then the volume of that is given by base times height,</span> <span m="3015000">and the height is F dot n. It is the same argument as what</span> <span m="3020000">we saw in the plane. OK.</span> <span m="3022000">Next time we will see more formulas.</span> <span m="3024000">We will first see how to prove this, more ways to do it,</span> <span m="3028000">more examples. And then we will get to the</span> <span m="3031000">divergence theorem.</span> </p>

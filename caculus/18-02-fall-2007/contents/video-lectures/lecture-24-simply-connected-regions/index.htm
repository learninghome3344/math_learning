So, before we actually start</span> <span m="25000">reviewing for the test, I still have to tell you a few</span> <span m="30000">small things because I promised to say a few words about what's</span> <span m="34000">the difference, or precisely,</span> <span m="37000">what's the difference between curl being zero and a field</span> <span m="41000">being a gradient field, and why we have this assumption</span> <span m="45000">that our vector field had to be defined everywhere for a field</span> <span m="49000">with curl zero to actually be conservative for our test for</span> <span m="53000">gradient fields to be valid? So -- More about validity of</span> <span m="64000">Green's theorem and things like that.</span> <span m="77000">So, we've seen the statement of Green's theorem in two forms.</span> <span m="89000">Both of them have to do with comparing a line integral along</span> <span m="93000">a closed curve to a double integral over the region inside</span> <span m="98000">enclosed by the curve. So,</span> <span m="101000">one of them says the line integral for the work done by a</span> <span m="105000">vector field along a closed curve counterclockwise is equal</span> <span m="110000">to the double integral of a curl of a field over the enclosed</span> <span m="114000">region. And, the other one says the</span> <span m="118000">total flux out of the region, so, the flux through the curve</span> <span m="125000">is equal to the double integral of divergence of a field in the</span> <span m="131000">region. So, in both cases,</span> <span m="133000">we need the vector field to be defined not only,</span> <span m="138000">I mean, the left hand side makes sense if a vector field is</span> <span m="141000">just defined on the curve because it's just a line</span> <span m="144000">integral on C. We don't care what happens</span> <span m="147000">inside. But, for the right-hand side to</span> <span m="149000">make sense, and therefore for the equality</span> <span m="151000">to make sense, we need the vector field to be</span> <span m="154000">defined everywhere inside the region.</span> <span m="158000">So, I said, if there is a point somewhere in here where my</span> <span m="161000">vector field is not defined, then it doesn't work.</span> <span m="165000">And actually, we've seen that example.</span> <span m="173000">So, this only works if F and its derivatives are defined</span> <span m="188000">everywhere in the region, R.</span> <span m="197000">Otherwise, we are in trouble. OK,</span> <span m="200000">so we've seen for example that if I gave you the vector field</span> <span m="209000">minus yi xj over x squared plus y squared,</span> <span m="215000">so that's the same vector field that was on that problem set a</span> <span m="220000">couple of weeks ago. Then, well, f is not defined at</span> <span m="225000">the origin, but it's defined everywhere else.</span> <span m="232000">And, wherever it's defined, it's curl is zero.</span> <span m="243000">I should say everywhere it's -- And so, if we have a closed</span> <span m="254000">curve in the plane, well, there's two situations.</span> <span m="264000">One is if it does not enclose the origin.</span> <span m="268000">Then, yes,</span> <span m="270000">we can apply Green's theorem and it will tell us that it's</span> <span m="276000">equal to the double integral in here of curl F dA,</span> <span m="282000">which will be zero because this is zero.</span> <span m="286000">However, if I have a curve that encloses</span> <span m="291000">the origin, let's say like this,</span> <span m="294000">for example, then,</span> <span m="303000">well, I cannot use the same method because the vector field</span> <span m="307000">and its curl are not defined at the origin.</span> <span m="311000">And, in fact, you know that ignoring the</span> <span m="314000">problem and saying, well, the curl is still zero</span> <span m="317000">everywhere, will give you the wrong answer</span> <span m="319000">because we've seen an example. We've seen that along the unit</span> <span m="323000">circle the total work is 2 pi not zero.</span> <span m="327000">So, we can't use Green. However, we can't use it</span> <span m="335000">directly. So, there is an extended</span> <span m="338000">version of Green's theorem that tells you the following thing.</span> <span m="344000">Well, it tells me that even though I</span> <span m="349000">can't do things for just this region enclosed by C prime,</span> <span m="354000">I can still do things for the region in between two different</span> <span m="358000">curves. OK, so let me show you what I</span> <span m="366000">have in mind. So, let's say that I have my</span> <span m="371000">curve C'. Where's my yellow chalk?</span> <span m="375000">Oh, here. So, I have this curve C'.</span> <span m="382000">I can't apply Green's theorem inside it, but let's get out the</span> <span m="390000">smaller thing. So, that one I'm going to make</span> <span m="394000">going clockwise. You will see why.</span> <span m="401000">Then, I could say, well, let me change my mind.</span> <span m="408000">This picture is not very well prepared.</span> <span m="409000">That's because my writer is on strike.</span> <span m="413000">OK, so let's say we have C' and C'' both going counterclockwise.</span> <span m="422000">Then, I claim that Green's theorem</span> <span m="425000">still applies, and tells me that the line</span> <span m="429000">integral along C prime minus the line integral along C double</span> <span m="434000">prime is equal to the double integral over the region in</span> <span m="439000">between. So here, now,</span> <span m="443000">it's this region with the hole of the curve.</span> <span m="455000">And, well, in our case, that will turn out to be zero</span> <span m="461000">because curl is zero. OK, so this doesn't tell us</span> <span m="465000">what each of these two line integrals is.</span> <span m="467000">But actually, it tells us that they are equal</span> <span m="469000">to each other. And so, by computing one,</span> <span m="471000">you can see actually that for this vector field,</span> <span m="473000">if you take any curve that goes counterclockwise around the</span> <span m="477000">origin, you would get two pi no matter</span> <span m="480000">what the curve is. So how do you get to this?</span> <span m="484000">Why is this not like conceptually a new theorem?</span> <span m="487000">Well, just think of the following thing.</span> <span m="493000">I'm not going to do it on top of that because it's going to be</span> <span m="497000">messy if I draw too many things. But, so here I have my C''.</span> <span m="503000">Here, I have C'. Let me actually make a slit</span> <span m="509000">that will connect them to each other like this.</span> <span m="513000">So now if I take, see,</span> <span m="517000">I can form a single closed curve that will enclose all of</span> <span m="523000">this region with kind of an infinitely thin slit here</span> <span m="529000">counterclockwise. And so, if I go</span> <span m="532000">counterclockwise around this region, basically I go</span> <span m="535000">counterclockwise along the outer curve.</span> <span m="538000">Then I go along the slit. Then I go clockwise along the</span> <span m="541000">inside curve, then back along the slit.</span> <span m="544000">And then I'm done. So,</span> <span m="547000">if I take the line integral along this big curve consisting</span> <span m="551000">of all these pieces, now I can apply Green's theorem</span> <span m="555000">to that because it is the usual counterclockwise curve that goes</span> <span m="559000">around a region where my field is well-defined.</span> <span m="562000">See, I've eliminated the origin from the picture.</span> <span m="567000">And, so the total line integral for this thing is equal to the</span> <span m="577000">integral along C prime, I guess the outer one.</span> <span m="586000">Then, I also need to have what I do along the inner side.</span> <span m="590000">And, the inner side is going to be C double prime,</span> <span m="592000">but going backwards because now I'm going clockwise on C prime</span> <span m="597000">so that I'm going counterclockwise around the</span> <span m="601000">shaded region. Well, of course there will be</span> <span m="604000">contributions from the line integral along this wide</span> <span m="606000">segment. But, I do it twice,</span> <span m="608000">once each way. So, they cancel out.</span> <span m="617000">So, the white segments cancel out.</span> <span m="621000">You probably shouldn't, in your notes,</span> <span m="623000">write down white segments because probably they are not</span> <span m="625000">white on your paper. But, hopefully you get the</span> <span m="629000">meaning of what I'm trying to say.</span> <span m="633000">OK, so basically that tells you, you can still play tricks</span> <span m="636000">with Green's theorem when the region has holes in it.</span> <span m="639000">You just had to be careful and somehow subtract some other</span> <span m="644000">curve so that together things will work out.</span> <span m="648000">There is a similar thing with the divergence theorem,</span> <span m="651000">of course, with flux and double integral of div f,</span> <span m="655000">you can apply exactly the same argument.</span> <span m="658000">OK, so basically you can apply Green's theorem for a region</span> <span m="662000">that has several boundary curves.</span> <span m="664000">You just have to be careful that the outer boundary must go</span> <span m="667000">counterclockwise. The inner boundary either goes</span> <span m="673000">clockwise, or you put a minus sign.</span> <span m="679000">OK, and the last cultural note,</span> <span m="686000">so, the definition, we say that a region in the</span> <span m="694000">plane, sorry, I should say a connected</span> <span m="696000">region in the plane, so that means -- So,</span> <span m="705000">connected means it consists of a single piece.</span> <span m="707000">OK, so, connected, there is a single piece.</span> <span m="710000">These two guys together are not connected.</span> <span m="713000">But, if I join them, then this is a connected</span> <span m="718000">region. We say it's simply connected --</span> <span m="728000">-- if any closed curve in it, OK,</span> <span m="737000">so I need to gave a name to my region,</span> <span m="738000">let's say R, any closed curve in R,</span> <span m="742000">bounds, no,</span> <span m="749000">sorry. If the interior of any closed</span> <span m="757000">curve in R -- -- is also contained in R.</span> <span m="769000">So, concretely, what does that mean?</span> <span m="771000">That means the region, R, does not have any holes</span> <span m="777000">inside it. Maybe I should draw two</span> <span m="782000">pictures to explain what I mean. So,</span> <span m="788000">this guy here is simply connected while -- -- this guy</span> <span m="797000">here is not simply connected because if I take this curve,</span> <span m="809000">that's a curve inside my region. But, the piece that it bounds</span> <span m="814000">is not actually entirely contained in my origin.</span> <span m="818000">And, so why is that relevant? Well,</span> <span m="821000">if you know that your vector field is defined everywhere in a</span> <span m="825000">simply connected region, then you don't have to worry</span> <span m="827000">about this question of, can I apply Green's theorem to</span> <span m="830000">the inside? You know it's automatically OK</span> <span m="832000">because if you have a closed curve,</span> <span m="834000">then the vector field is, I mean, if a vector field is</span> <span m="839000">defined on the curve it will also be defined inside.</span> <span m="843000">OK, so if the domain of definition</span> <span m="851000">-- -- of a vector field is defined and differentiable -- --</span> <span m="865000">is simply connected -- -- then we can always apply -- --</span> <span m="878000">Green's theorem -- -- and, of course,</span> <span m="887000">provided that we do it on a curve where the vector field is</span> <span m="889000">defined. I mean, your line integral</span> <span m="890000">doesn't make sense so there's nothing to compute.</span> <span m="893000">But, if you have, so, again, the argument would</span> <span m="896000">be, well, if a vector field is defined on the curve,</span> <span m="899000">it's also defined inside. So,</span> <span m="901000">see, the problem with that vector</span> <span m="904000">field here is precisely that its domain of definition is not</span> <span m="907000">simply connected because there is a hole,</span> <span m="909000">namely the origin. OK, so for this guy,</span> <span m="917000">domain of definition, which is plane minus the origin</span> <span m="928000">with the origin removed is not simply connected.</span> <span m="939000">And so that's why you have this line integral that makes perfect</span> <span m="942000">sense, but you can't apply Green's theorem to it.</span> <span m="945000">So now, what does that mean a particular?</span> <span m="947000">Well, we've seen this criterion that if a curl of the vector</span> <span m="951000">field is zero and it's defined in the entire plane,</span> <span m="955000">then the vector field is conservative,</span> <span m="958000">and it's a gradient field. And, the argument to prove that</span> <span m="961000">is basically to use Green's theorem.</span> <span m="963000">So, in fact, the actual optimal statement</span> <span m="967000">you can make is if a vector field is defined in a simply</span> <span m="971000">connected region, and its curl is zero,</span> <span m="973000">then it's a gradient field. So, let me just write that down.</span> <span m="986000">So, the correct statement, I mean, the previous one we've</span> <span m="989000">seen is also correct. But this one is somehow better</span> <span m="995000">and closer to what exactly is needed if curl F is zero and the</span> <span m="1005000">domain of definition where F is defined is simply connected --</span> <span m="1015000">-- then F is conservative. And that means also it's a</span> <span m="1024000">gradient field. It's the same thing.</span> <span m="1031000">OK, any questions on this? No?</span> <span m="1043000">OK, some good news. What I've just said here won't</span> <span m="1047000">come up on the test on Thursday. OK.</span> <span m="1051000">(APPLAUSE) Still, it's stuff that you should be</span> <span m="1055000">aware of generally speaking because it will be useful,</span> <span m="1059000">say, on the next week's problem set.</span> <span m="1062000">And, maybe on the final it would be,</span> <span m="1066000">there won't be any really, really complicated things</span> <span m="1068000">probably, but you might need to be at</span> <span m="1073000">least vaguely aware of this issue of things being simply</span> <span m="1081000">connected. And by the way,</span> <span m="1084000">I mean, this is also somehow the starting point of topology,</span> <span m="1088000">which is the branch of math that studies the shapes of</span> <span m="1092000">regions. So,</span> <span m="1093000">in particular, you can try to distinguish</span> <span m="1095000">domains in the plains by looking at whether they're simply</span> <span m="1098000">connected or not, and what kinds of features they</span> <span m="1101000">have in terms of how you can joint point what kinds of curves</span> <span m="1105000">exist in them. And, since that's the branch of</span> <span m="1108000">math in which I work, I thought I should tell you a</span> <span m="1112000">bit about it. OK, so now back to reviewing</span> <span m="1121000">for the exam. So, I'm going to basically list</span> <span m="1127000">topics. And, if time permits,</span> <span m="1129000">I will say a few things about problems from practice exam 3B.</span> <span m="1133000">I'm hoping that you have it or your neighbor has it,</span> <span m="1136000">or you can somehow get it. Anyway, given time,</span> <span m="1139000">I'm not sure how much I will say about the problems in and of</span> <span m="1144000">themselves. OK, so the main thing to know</span> <span m="1148000">about this exam is how to set up and evaluate double integrals</span> <span m="1153000">and line integrals. OK, if you know how to do these</span> <span m="1157000">two things, then you are in much better shape than if you don't.</span> <span m="1166000">And -- So, the first thing we've seen, just to write it</span> <span m="1183000">down, there's two main objects. And, it's kind of important to</span> <span m="1195000">not confuse them with each other.</span> <span m="1197000">OK, there's double integrals of our regions of some quantity,</span> <span m="1202000">dA, and the other one is the line</span> <span m="1206000">integral along a curve of a vector field,</span> <span m="1211000">F.dr or F.Mds depending on whether it's work or flux that</span> <span m="1217000">we are trying to do. And, so we should know how to</span> <span m="1221000">set up these things and how to evaluate them.</span> <span m="1224000">And, roughly speaking, in this one you start by</span> <span m="1227000">drawing a picture of the region, then deciding which way you</span> <span m="1232000">will integrate it. It could be dx dy,</span> <span m="1234000">dy dx, r dr d theta,</span> <span m="1237000">and then you will set up the bound carefully by slicing it</span> <span m="1241000">and studying how the bounds for the inner variable depend on the</span> <span m="1245000">outer variable. So, the first topic will be</span> <span m="1251000">setting up double integrals. And so, remember,</span> <span m="1257000">OK, so maybe I should make this more explicit.</span> <span m="1263000">We want to draw a picture of R and take slices in the chosen</span> <span m="1272000">way so that we get an iterated integral.</span> <span m="1278000">OK, so let's do just a quick example.</span> <span m="1285000">So, if I look at problem one on the exam 3B,</span> <span m="1298000">it says to look at the line integral from zero to one,</span> <span m="1303000">line integral from x to 2x of possibly something,</span> <span m="1306000">but dy dx. And it says,</span> <span m="1310000">let's look at how we would set this up the other way around by</span> <span m="1318000">exchanging x and y. So, we should get to something</span> <span m="1323000">that will be the same integral dx dy.</span> <span m="1326000">I mean, if you have a function of x and y, then it will be the</span> <span m="1329000">same function. But, of course,</span> <span m="1331000">the bounds change. So, how do we exchange the</span> <span m="1334000">order of integration? Well, the only way to do it</span> <span m="1337000">consistently is to draw a picture.</span> <span m="1340000">So, let's see, what does this mean?</span> <span m="1343000">Here, it means we integrate from y equals x to y equals 2x,</span> <span m="1348000">x between zero and one. So, we should draw a picture.</span> <span m="1352000">The lower bound for y is y equals x.</span> <span m="1355000">So, let's draw y equals x. That seems to be here.</span> <span m="1361000">And, we'll go up to y equals 2x, which is a line also but</span> <span m="1367000">with bigger slope. And then, all right,</span> <span m="1372000">so for each value of x, my origin will go from x to 2x.</span> <span m="1378000">Well, and I do this for all values of x that go to x equals</span> <span m="1383000">one. So, I stop at x equals one,</span> <span m="1386000">which is here. And then, my region is</span> <span m="1390000">something like this. OK, so this point here,</span> <span m="1395000">in case you are wondering, well, when x equals one,</span> <span m="1401000">y is one. And that point here is one, two.</span> <span m="1407000">OK, any questions about that so far?</span> <span m="1409000">OK, so somehow that's the first kill, when you see an integral,</span> <span m="1413000">how to figure out what it means, how to draw the region.</span> <span m="1416000">And then there's a converse scale which is given the region,</span> <span m="1419000">how to set up the integral for it.</span> <span m="1422000">So, if we want to set up instead dx dy,</span> <span m="1426000">then it means we are going to actually look at the converse</span> <span m="1430000">question which is, for a given value of y,</span> <span m="1434000">what is the range of values of x?</span> <span m="1437000">OK, so if we fix y, well, where do we enter the</span> <span m="1441000">region, and where do we leave it?</span> <span m="1444000">So, we seem to enter on this side, and we seem to leave on</span> <span m="1448000">that side. At least that seems to be true</span> <span m="1450000">for the first few values of y that I choose.</span> <span m="1452000">But, hey, if I take a larger value of y, then I will enter on</span> <span m="1456000">the side, and I will leave on this vertical side,</span> <span m="1459000">not on that one. So, I seem to have two</span> <span m="1462000">different things going on. OK, the place where enter my</span> <span m="1468000">region is always y equals 2x, which is the same as x equals y</span> <span m="1478000">over two. So, x seems to always start at</span> <span m="1485000">y over two. But, where I leave to be either</span> <span m="1491000">x equals y, or here, x equals y.</span> <span m="1495000">And, that depends on the value of y.</span> <span m="1497000">So, in fact, I have to break this into two</span> <span m="1499000">different integrals. I have to treat separately the</span> <span m="1503000">case where y is between zero and one, and between one and two.</span> <span m="1507000">So, what I do in that case is I just make two integrals.</span> <span m="1515000">So, I say, both of them start at y over two.</span> <span m="1518000">But, in the first case, we'll stop at x equals y.</span> <span m="1522000">In the second case, we'll stop at x equals one.</span> <span m="1530000">OK, and now, what are the values of y for</span> <span m="1531000">each case? Well, the first case is when y</span> <span m="1534000">is between zero and one. The second case is when y is</span> <span m="1538000">between one and two, which I guess this picture now</span> <span m="1540000">is completely unreadable, but hopefully you've been</span> <span m="1544000">following what's going on, or else you can see it in the</span> <span m="1548000">solutions to the problem. And, so that's our final answer.</span> <span m="1553000">OK, any questions about how to set up double integrals in xy</span> <span m="1561000">coordinates? No?</span> <span m="1564000">OK, who feels comfortable with this kind of problem?</span> <span m="1567000">OK, good. I'm happy to see the vast</span> <span m="1571000">majority. So, the bad news is we have to</span> <span m="1576000">be able to do it not only in xy coordinates, but also in polar</span> <span m="1583000">coordinates. So, when you go to polar</span> <span m="1587000">coordinates, basically all you have to remember on the side of</span> <span m="1592000">integrand is that x becomes r cosine theta.</span> <span m="1596000">Y becomes r sine theta. And, dx dy becomes r dr d theta.</span> <span m="1605000">In terms of how you slice for your region, well,</span> <span m="1609000">you will be integrating first over r.</span> <span m="1612000">So, that means what you're doing is you're fixing the value</span> <span m="1617000">of theta. And, for that value of theta,</span> <span m="1619000">you ask yourself, for what range of values of r</span> <span m="1623000">am I going to be inside my origin?</span> <span m="1626000">So, if my origin looks like this, then for this value of</span> <span m="1629000">theta, r would go from zero to whatever this distance is.</span> <span m="1633000">And of course I have to find how this distance depends on</span> <span m="1636000">theta. And then, I will find the</span> <span m="1638000">extreme values of theta. Now, of course,</span> <span m="1640000">is the origin is really looking like this, then you're not going</span> <span m="1642000">to do it in polar coordinates. But, if it's like a circle or a</span> <span m="1645000">half circle, or things like that,</span> <span m="1647000">then even if a problem doesn't tell you to do it in polar</span> <span m="1651000">coordinates you might want to seriously consider it.</span> <span m="1654000">OK, so I'm not going to do it but problem two in the practice</span> <span m="1658000">exam is a good example of doing something in polar coordinates.</span> <span m="1663000">OK, so in terms of things that we</span> <span m="1670000">do with double integrals, there's a few formulas that I'd</span> <span m="1676000">like you to remember about applications that we've seen of</span> <span m="1680000">double integrals. So, quantities that we can</span> <span m="1684000">compute with double integrals include things like the area of</span> <span m="1690000">region, its mass if it has a density,</span> <span m="1693000">the average value of some function,</span> <span m="1696000">for example, the average value of the x and</span> <span m="1699000">y coordinates, which we called the center of</span> <span m="1702000">mass or moments of inertia. So, these are just formulas to</span> <span m="1711000">remember. So, for example,</span> <span m="1715000">the area of region is the double integral of just dA,</span> <span m="1720000">or if it helps you, one dA if you want.</span> <span m="1724000">You are integrating the function 1.</span> <span m="1727000">You have to remember formulas for mass,</span> <span m="1729000">for the average value of a function is the F bar,</span> <span m="1734000">in particular x bar y bar, which is the center of mass,</span> <span m="1745000">and the moment of inertia. OK, so the polar moment of</span> <span m="1754000">inertia, which is moment of inertia about the origin.</span> <span m="1758000">OK, so that's double integral of x squared plus y squared,</span> <span m="1762000">density dA, but also moments of inertia</span> <span m="1767000">about the x and y axis, which are given by just taking</span> <span m="1773000">one of these guys. Don't worry about moments of</span> <span m="1776000">inertia about an arbitrary line. I will ask you for a moment of</span> <span m="1779000">inertia for some weird line or something like that.</span> <span m="1782000">OK, but these you should know. Now, what if you somehow,</span> <span m="1787000">on the spur of the moment, you forget, what's the formula</span> <span m="1789000">for moment of inertia? Well, I mean,</span> <span m="1791000">I prefer if you know, but if you have a complete</span> <span m="1794000">blank in your memory, there will still be partial</span> <span m="1796000">credit were setting up the bounds and everything else.</span> <span m="1799000">So, the general rule for the exam</span> <span m="1801000">will be if you're stuck in a calculation or you're missing a</span> <span m="1804000">little piece of the puzzle, try to do as much as you can.</span> <span m="1808000">In particular, try to at least set up the</span> <span m="1810000">bounds of the integral. There will be partial credit</span> <span m="1815000">for that always. So, while we're at it about</span> <span m="1821000">grand rules, how about evaluation?</span> <span m="1826000">How about evaluating integrals? So, once you've set it up,</span> <span m="1831000">you have to sometimes compute it.</span> <span m="1833000">First of all, check just in case the problem</span> <span m="1836000">says set up but do not evaluate. Then, don't waste your time</span> <span m="1840000">evaluating it. If a problem says to compute</span> <span m="1845000">it, then you have to compute it. So, what kinds of integration</span> <span m="1850000">techniques do you need to know? So, you need to know,</span> <span m="1854000">you must know, well, how to integrate the</span> <span m="1857000">usual functions like one over x or x to the n,</span> <span m="1861000">or exponential, sine, cosine,</span> <span m="1865000">things like that, OK, so the usual integrals.</span> <span m="1868000">You must know what I will call easy trigonometry.</span> <span m="1876000">OK, I don't want to give you a complete list.</span> <span m="1877000">And the more you ask me about which ones are on the list,</span> <span m="1880000">the more I will add to the list.</span> <span m="1882000">But, those that you know that you should know,</span> <span m="1886000">you should know. Those that you think you</span> <span m="1888000">shouldn't know, you don't have to know because</span> <span m="1891000">I will say what I will say soon. You should know also</span> <span m="1896000">substitution, how to set U equals something,</span> <span m="1901000">and then see, oh, this becomes u times du,</span> <span m="1905000">and so substitution method. What do I mean by easy</span> <span m="1910000">trigonometrics? Well, certainly you should know</span> <span m="1912000">how to ingrate sine. You should know how to</span> <span m="1914000">integrate cosine. You should be aware that sine</span> <span m="1917000">squared plus cosine squared simplifies to one.</span> <span m="1921000">And, you should be aware of general things like that.</span> <span m="1923000">I would like you to know, maybe, the double angles,</span> <span m="1926000">sine 2x and cosine 2x. Know what these are,</span> <span m="1929000">and the kinds of the easy things you can do with that,</span> <span m="1932000">also things that involve substitution setting like U</span> <span m="1936000">equals sine T or U equals cosine T.</span> <span m="1939000">I mean, let me, instead, give an example of</span> <span m="1941000">hard trig that you don't need to know, and then I will answer.</span> <span m="1945000">OK, so, not needed on Thursday; it doesn't mean that I don't</span> <span m="1954000">want you to know them. I would love you to know every</span> <span m="1957000">single integral formula. But, that shouldn't be your top</span> <span m="1961000">priority. So, you don't need to know</span> <span m="1964000">things like hard trigonometric ones.</span> <span m="1967000">So, let me give you an example. OK, so if I ask you to do this</span> <span m="1972000">one, then actually I will give you maybe, you know,</span> <span m="1975000">I will reprint the formula from the notes or something like</span> <span m="1979000">that. OK, so that one you don't need</span> <span m="1982000">to know. I would love if you happen to</span> <span m="1984000">know it, but if you need it, it will be given to you.</span> <span m="1987000">So, these kinds of things that you cannot compute by any easy</span> <span m="1993000">method. And, integration by parts,</span> <span m="1996000">I believe that I successfully test-solved all the problems</span> <span m="2001000">without doing any single integration by parts.</span> <span m="2006000">Again, in general, it's something that I would</span> <span m="2009000">like you to know, but it shouldn't be a top</span> <span m="2013000">priority for this week. OK, sorry, you had a question,</span> <span m="2020000">or? Inverse trigonometric</span> <span m="2022000">functions: let's say the most easy ones.</span> <span m="2025000">I would like you to know the easiest inverse trig functions,</span> <span m="2030000">but not much. OK, OK, so be aware that these</span> <span m="2036000">functions exist, but it's not a top priority.</span> <span m="2044000">I should say, the more I tell you I don't</span> <span m="2046000">need you to know, the more your physics and other</span> <span m="2048000">teachers might complain that, oh, these guys don't know how</span> <span m="2051000">to integrate. So, try not to forget</span> <span m="2052000">everything. But, yes?</span> <span m="2059000">No, no, here I just mean for evaluating just a single</span> <span m="2062000">variable integral. I will get to change variables</span> <span m="2064000">and Jacobian soon, but I'm thinking of this as a</span> <span m="2067000">different topic. What I mean by this one is if</span> <span m="2069000">I'm asking you to integrate, I don't know,</span> <span m="2072000">what's a good example? Zero to one t dt over square</span> <span m="2077000">root of one plus t squared, then you should think of maybe</span> <span m="2082000">substituting u equals one plus t squared,</span> <span m="2084000">and then it becomes easier. OK, so this kind of trig,</span> <span m="2095000">that's what I have in mind here specifically.</span> <span m="2100000">And again, if you're stuck,</span> <span m="2102000">in particular, if you hit this dreaded guy,</span> <span m="2105000">and you don't actually have a formula giving you what it is,</span> <span m="2109000">it means one of two things. One is something's wrong with</span> <span m="2112000">your solution. The other option is something</span> <span m="2113000">is wrong with my problem. So, either way,</span> <span m="2116000">check quickly what you've done it if you can't find a mistake,</span> <span m="2122000">then just move ahead to the next problem.</span> <span m="2127000">Which one, this one? Yeah,</span> <span m="2130000">I mean if you can do it, if you know how to do it,</span> <span m="2132000">which everything is fair: I mean,</span> <span m="2133000">generally speaking, give enough of it so that you</span> <span m="2136000">found the solution by yourself, not like,</span> <span m="2138000">you know, it didn't somehow come to you by magic.</span> <span m="2143000">But, yeah, if you know how to integrate this without doing the</span> <span m="2147000">substitution, that's absolutely fine by me.</span> <span m="2149000">Just show enough work. The general rule is show enough</span> <span m="2153000">work that we see that you knew what you are doing.</span> <span m="2158000">OK, now another thing we've seen with double integrals is</span> <span m="2162000">how to do more complicated changes of variables.</span> <span m="2178000">So, when you want to replace x and y by some variables,</span> <span m="2183000">u and v, given by some formulas in terms of x and y.</span> <span m="2188000">So, you need to remember basically how to do them.</span> <span m="2193000">So, you need to remember that the method consists of three</span> <span m="2196000">steps. So, one is you have to find the</span> <span m="2203000">Jacobian. And, you can choose to do</span> <span m="2206000">either this Jacobian or the inverse one depending on what's</span> <span m="2210000">easiest given what you're given. You don't have to worry about</span> <span m="2213000">solving for things the other way around.</span> <span m="2215000">Just compute one of these Jacobians.</span> <span m="2218000">And then, the rule is that du dv is absolute value of the</span> <span m="2226000">Jacobian dx dy. So, that takes care of dx dy,</span> <span m="2232000">how to convert that into du dv. The second thing to know is</span> <span m="2238000">that, well,</span> <span m="2240000">you need to of course substitute any x and y's in the</span> <span m="2245000">integrand to convert them to u's and v's so that you have a valid</span> <span m="2252000">integrand involving only u and v.</span> <span m="2256000">And then, the last part is setting up the bounds.</span> <span m="2271000">And you see that, probably you seen on P-sets and</span> <span m="2274000">an example we did in the lecture that this can be complicated.</span> <span m="2278000">But now, in real life, you do this actually to</span> <span m="2280000">simplify the integrals. So,</span> <span m="2282000">probably the one that will be there on Thursday,</span> <span m="2284000">if there's a problem about that on Thursday,</span> <span m="2287000">it will be a situation where the bounds that you get after</span> <span m="2290000">changing variables are reasonably easy.</span> <span m="2293000">OK, I'm not saying that it will be completely obvious</span> <span m="2295000">necessarily, but it will be a fairly easy situation.</span> <span m="2297000">So, the general method is you look at your region,</span> <span m="2302000">R, and it might have various sides.</span> <span m="2305000">Well, on each side you ask yourself, what do I know about x</span> <span m="2309000">and y, and how to convert that in terms of u and v?</span> <span m="2313000">And maybe you'll find that the equation might be just u equals</span> <span m="2317000">zero for example, or u equals v,</span> <span m="2319000">or something like that. And then, it's up to you to</span> <span m="2322000">decide what you want to do. But, maybe the easiest usually</span> <span m="2326000">is to draw a new picture in terms of u and v coordinates of</span> <span m="2329000">what your region will look like in the new coordinates.</span> <span m="2333000">It might be that it will actually much easier.</span> <span m="2335000">It should be easier looking than what you started with.</span> <span m="2340000">OK, so that's the general idea. There is one change of variable</span> <span m="2345000">problem on each of the two practice exams to give you a</span> <span m="2349000">feeling for what's realistic. The problem that's on practice</span> <span m="2353000">exam 3B actually is on the hard side of things because the</span> <span m="2358000">question is kind of hidden in a way.</span> <span m="2361000">So, if you look at problem six, you might find that it's not</span> <span m="2365000">telling you very clearly what you have to do.</span> <span m="2368000">That's because it was meant to be the hardest problem on that</span> <span m="2374000">test. But, once you've reduced it to</span> <span m="2377000">an actual change of variables problem, I expect you to be able</span> <span m="2381000">to know how to do it. And, on practice exam 3A,</span> <span m="2384000">there's also, I think it's problem five on</span> <span m="2388000">the other practice exam. And, that one is actually</span> <span m="2392000">pretty standard and straightforward.</span> <span m="2395000">OK, time to move on, sorry. So, we've also seen about line</span> <span m="2400000">integrals.</span> <span m="2421000">OK, so line integrals,</span> <span m="2430000">so the main thing to know about them,</span> <span m="2433000">so the line integral for work, which is line integral of F.dr,</span> <span m="2437000">so let's say that your vector field has components,</span> <span m="2440000">M and N. So, the line integral for work</span> <span m="2449000">becomes in coordinates integral of Mdx plus Ndy while we've also</span> <span m="2457000">seen line integral for flux. So, line integral of F.n ds</span> <span m="2465000">becomes the integral along C just to make sure that I give it</span> <span m="2473000">to you correctly. So, remember that just,</span> <span m="2478000">I don't want to make the mistake in front of you.</span> <span m="2482000">So, T ds is dx, dy. And, the normal vector,</span> <span m="2490000">so, T ds goes along the curve. Nds goes clockwise</span> <span m="2496000">perpendicular to the curve. So, it's going to be,</span> <span m="2501000">well, it's going to be dy and negative dx.</span> <span m="2508000">So, you will be integrating negative Ndx plus Mdy.</span> <span m="2520000">OK, see, if you are blanking and don't remember the signs,</span> <span m="2524000">then you can just draw this picture and make sure that you</span> <span m="2527000">get it right. So, you should know a little</span> <span m="2530000">bit about geometric interpretation and how to see</span> <span m="2534000">easily that it's going to be zero in some cases.</span> <span m="2537000">But, mostly you should know how to compute, set up and compute</span> <span m="2541000">these things. So, what do we do when we are</span> <span m="2543000">here? Well, it's year,</span> <span m="2544000">we have both x and y together, but we want to,</span> <span m="2547000">because it's the line integral, there should be only one</span> <span m="2550000">variable. So, the important thing to know</span> <span m="2554000">is we want to reduce everything to a single parameter.</span> <span m="2559000">OK, so the evaluation method is always by reducing to a single</span> <span m="2575000">parameter. So, for example,</span> <span m="2581000">maybe x and y are both functions of some variable,</span> <span m="2586000">t, and then express everything in</span> <span m="2590000">terms of some integral of, some quantity involving t dt.</span> <span m="2598000">It could be that you will just express everything in terms of x</span> <span m="2601000">or in terms of y, or in terms of some angle or</span> <span m="2604000">something. It's up to you to choose how to</span> <span m="2606000">parameterize things. And then, when you're there,</span> <span m="2609000">it's a usual one variable integral with a single variable</span> <span m="2613000">in there. OK, so that's the general</span> <span m="2616000">method of calculation, but we've seen a shortcut for</span> <span m="2620000">work when we can show that the field is the gradient of</span> <span m="2625000">potential. So,</span> <span m="2628000">one thing to know is if the curl of F,</span> <span m="2635000">which is an x minus My happens to be zero,</span> <span m="2641000">well, and now I can say,</span> <span m="2643000">and the domain is simply connected,</span> <span m="2646000">or if the field is defined everywhere,</span> <span m="2651000">then F is actually a gradient field.</span> <span m="2659000">So, that means, just to make it more concrete,</span> <span m="2662000">that means we can find a function little f called the</span> <span m="2666000">potential such that its derivative respect to x is M,</span> <span m="2670000">and its derivative with respect to Y is N.</span> <span m="2672000">We can solve these two conditions for the same</span> <span m="2677000">function, f, simultaneously. And, how do we find this</span> <span m="2682000">function, little f? OK, so that's the same as</span> <span m="2686000">saying that the field, big F, is the gradient of</span> <span m="2690000">little f. And, how do we find this</span> <span m="2692000">function, little f? Well, we've seen two methods.</span> <span m="2694000">One of them involves computing a line integral from the origin</span> <span m="2698000">to a point in the plane by going first along the x axis,</span> <span m="2702000">then vertically. The other method was to first</span> <span m="2705000">figure out what this one tells us by integrating it with</span> <span m="2709000">respect to x. And then, we differentiate our</span> <span m="2712000">answer with respect to y, and we compare with that to get</span> <span m="2717000">the complete answer. OK, so I is that relevant?</span> <span m="2720000">Well, first of all it's relevant in</span> <span m="2722000">physics, but it's also relevant just to</span> <span m="2725000">calculation of line integrals because we see the fundamental</span> <span m="2729000">theorem of calculus for line integrals which says if we are</span> <span m="2734000">integrating a gradient field and we know what the potential is.</span> <span m="2739000">Then, we just have to, well, the line integral is just</span> <span m="2743000">the change in value of a potential.</span> <span m="2746000">OK, so we take the value of a potential at the starting point,</span> <span m="2749000">sorry, we take value potential at the endpoint minus the value</span> <span m="2752000">at the starting point. And, that will give us the line</span> <span m="2758000">integral, OK? So, important:</span> <span m="2760000">this is only for work. There's no statement like that</span> <span m="2765000">for flux, OK, so don't tried to fly this in a</span> <span m="2769000">problem about flux. I mean, usually,</span> <span m="2771000">if you look at the practice exams,</span> <span m="2773000">you will see it's pretty clear that there's one problem in</span> <span m="2777000">which you are supposed to do things this way.</span> <span m="2780000">It's kind of a dead giveaway, but it's probably not too bad.</span> <span m="2785000">OK, and the other thing we've seen, so I mentioned it at the</span> <span m="2789000">beginning but let me mention it again.</span> <span m="2792000">To compute things, Green's theorem,</span> <span m="2796000">let's just compute, well, let us forget,</span> <span m="2802000">sorry, find the value of a line integral along the closed curve</span> <span m="2805000">by reducing it to double integral.</span> <span m="2807000">So, the one for work says -- --</span> <span m="2815000">this, and you should remember that in</span> <span m="2819000">there, so C is a closed curve that</span> <span m="2821000">goes counterclockwise, and R is the region inside.</span> <span m="2825000">So, the way you would, if you had to compute both</span> <span m="2828000">sides separately, you would do them in extremely</span> <span m="2830000">different ways, right?</span> <span m="2832000">This one is a line integral. So, you use the method to</span> <span m="2835000">explain here, namely, you express x and y in</span> <span m="2838000">terms of a single variable. See that you're doing a circle.</span> <span m="2842000">I want to see a theta. I don't want to see an R.</span> <span m="2844000">R is not a variable. You are on the circle.</span> <span m="2847000">This one is a double integral. So, if you are doing it,</span> <span m="2850000">say, on a disk, you would have both R and theta</span> <span m="2852000">if you're using polar coordinates.</span> <span m="2854000">You would have both x and y. Here, you have two variables of</span> <span m="2857000">integration. Here, you should have only one</span> <span m="2860000">after you parameterize the curve.</span> <span m="2862000">And, the fact that it stays curl F, I mean,</span> <span m="2866000">curl F is just Nx-My is just like any function of x and y.</span> <span m="2871000">OK, the fact that we called it curl F doesn't change how you</span> <span m="2874000">compute it. You have first to compute the</span> <span m="2876000">curl of F. Say you find,</span> <span m="2878000">I don't know, xy minus x squared,</span> <span m="2880000">well, it becomes just the usual double integral of the usual</span> <span m="2884000">function xy minus x squared. There's nothing special to it</span> <span m="2889000">because it's a curl. And, the other one is the</span> <span m="2895000">counterpart for flux. So, it says this,</span> <span m="2901000">and remember this is mx plus ny.</span> <span m="2905000">I mean, what's important about these statements is not only</span> <span m="2907000">remembering, you know, if you just know this formula</span> <span m="2910000">by heart, you are still in trouble</span> <span m="2912000">because you need to know what actually the symbols in here</span> <span m="2915000">mean. So, you should remember,</span> <span m="2917000">what is this line integral, and what's the divergence of a</span> <span m="2920000">field? So, just something to remember.</span> <span m="2927000">And, so I guess I'll let you figure out practice problems</span> <span m="2931000">because it's time, but I think that's basically</span> <span m="2934000">the list of all we've seen. And, well, that should be it.</span> </p>

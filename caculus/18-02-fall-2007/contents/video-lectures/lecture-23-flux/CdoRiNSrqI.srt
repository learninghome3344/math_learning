8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today I am going to tell you
about flux of a vector field for

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
a curve.
In case you have seen flux in

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
physics,
probably you have seen flux in

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
space,
and we are going to come to

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that in a couple of weeks,
but for now we are still doing

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
everything in the plane.
So bear with me if you have

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
seen a more complicated version
of flux.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We are going to do the easy one
first.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is flux?
Well, flux is actually another

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:10,000
kind of line integral.
Let's say that I have a plane

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
curve and a vector field in the
plane.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then the flux of F across a
curve C is, by definition,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
a line integral,
but I will use notation F dot n

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ds.
I have to explain to you what

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it means, but let me first box
that because that is the

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
important formula to remember.
That is the definition.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What does that mean?
First, mostly I have to tell

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you what this little n is.
The notation suggests it is a

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
normal vector,
so what does that mean?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have a curve in the plane and
I have a vector field.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's see.
The vector field will be yellow

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
today.
And I will want to integrate

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
along the curve the dot product
of F with the normal vector to

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the curve, a unit normal vector
to the curve.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That means a vector that is at
every point of the curve

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
perpendicular to the curve and
has length one.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:06,000
N everywhere will be the unit
normal vector to the curve C

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
pointing 90 degrees clockwise
from T.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What does that mean?
That means I have two normal

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
vectors, one that is pointing
this way, one that is pointing

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that way.
I have to choose a convention.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And the convention is that the
normal vector that I take goes

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to the right of the curve as I
am traveling along the curve.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You mentioned that you were
walking along this curve,

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
then you look to your right,
that is that direction.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What we will do is just,
at every point along the curve,

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the dot product between the
vector field and the normal

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
vector.
And we will sum that along the

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
various pieces of the curve.
What this notation means is

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
that if we actually break C into
small pieces of length delta(s)

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
then the flux will be the limit,
as the pieces become smaller

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and smaller,
of the sum of F dot n delta S.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I take each small piece of my
curve, I do the dot product

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
between F and n and I multiply
by the length of a piece.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then I add these together.
That is what the line integral

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
means.
Of course that is,

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
again, not how I will compute
it.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just to compare this with work,
conceptually it is similar to

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the line integral we did for
work except the line integral

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
for work -- Work is the line
integral of F dot dr,

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
which is also the line integral
of F dot T ds.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That is how we reformulated it.
That means we take our curve

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and we figure out at each point
how big the tangent component --

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I guess I should probably take
the same vector field as before.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's see.
My field was pointing more like

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that way.
What I do at any point is

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
project F to the tangent
direction, I figure out how much

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
F is going along my curve and
then I sum these things

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:02,000
together.
I am actually summing -- -- the

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:14,000
tangential component of my field
F.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Roughly-speaking the work
measures, you know,

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
when I move along my curve,
how much I am going with or

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
against F.
Flux, on the other hand,

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
measures, when I go along the
curve, roughly how much the

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
field is going to across the
curve.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Counting positively what goes
to the right,

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
negatively what goes to the
left.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Flux is integral F dot n ds,
and that one corresponds to

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
summing the normal component of
a vector field.

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But apart from that
conceptually it is the same kind

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
of thing.
Just the physical

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
interpretations will be very
different,

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but for a mathematician these
are two line integrals that you

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
set up and compute in pretty
much the same way.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's see.
I should probably tell you what

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it means.
Why do we make this definition?

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What does it correspond to?
Well, the interpretation for

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
work made a lot of sense when F
was representing a force.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The line integral was actually
the work done by the force.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The interpretation for flux
makes more sense if you think of

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
F as a velocity field.
What is the interpretation?

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's say that for F is a
velocity field.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That means I am thinking of
some fluid that is moving,

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
maybe water or something,
and it is moving at a certain

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
speed.
And my vector field represents

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
how things are moving at every
point of the plane.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I claim that flux measures how
much fluid passes through -- --

95
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the curve C per unit time.
If you imagine that maybe you

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
have a river and you are somehow
building a damn here,

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
a damn with holes in it so that
the water still passes through,

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
then this measures how much
water passes through your

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
membrane per unit time.
Let's try to figure out why

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
this is true.
Why does this make sense?

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's look at what happens on a
small portion of our curve C.

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am zooming in on my curve C.
I guess I need to zoom further.

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That is a little piece of my
curve, of length delta S,

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and there is a fluid flow.
On my picture things are

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
flowing to the right.
Here I am drawing a constant

106
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
vector field because if you zoom
in enough then your vectors will

107
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
pretty much be the same
everywhere.

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you enlarge the picture
enough then things will be

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
pretty much a uniform flow.
Now, how much stuff goes

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
through this little piece of
curve per unit time?

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, what happens over time is
the fluid is moving while my

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
curve is staying the same place
so it corresponds to something

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
like this.
I claim that what goes through

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
C in unit time is actually going
to be a parallelogram.

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Here is a better picture.
I claim that what will be going

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
through C is this shaded
parallelogram to the left of C.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's see.
If I move for unit time it

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
works.
That is the stuff that goes

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
through my curve,
for a small portion of curve in

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
unit time.
And, of course,

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I would need to add all of
these together to get the entire

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
curve.
Let's try to understand how big

123
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this parallelogram is.
To know how big this

124
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
parallelogram is I would like to
use base times height or

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
something like that.
And maybe I want to actually

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
flip my picture so that the base
and the height make more sense

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to me.
Let me actually turn it this

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
way.
And, in case you have trouble

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,000
reading the rotated picture,
let me redo it on the board.

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What passes through a portion
of C in unit time is the

131
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
contents of a parallelogram
whose base is on C.

132
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So it has length delta s.
That is a piece of C.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And the other side is going to
be given by my velocity vector

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
F.
And to find the height of this

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
thing, I need to know what
actually the normal component of

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
this vector is.
If I call n the unit normal

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:35,000
vector to the curve then the
area is base times height.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The base is delta S and the
height is the normal component

139
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
of F, so it is F dot n.
And so you see that when you

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
sum these things together you
get, what I said,

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
flux.
Now, if you are worried about

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the fact that actually -- If
your unit time is too long then

143
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
of course things might start
changing as it flows.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have to take the time unit
and the length unit that are

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
sufficiently small so that
really this approximation where

146
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
C is a straight line and where
flow is at constant speed are

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
valid.
You want to take maybe a

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
segment here that is a few
micrometers.

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And the time unit might be a
few nanoseconds or whatever,

150
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and then it is a good
approximation.

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What I mean by per unit time
is, well, actually,

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
that works, but you want to
think of a really,

153
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
really small time.
And then the amount of matter

154
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that passes in that really,
really small time is the flux

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
times the amount of time.
Let's be a tiny bit more

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
careful.
And what I am saying is the

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
amount of stuff that passes
through C depends actually on

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
whether n is going this way or
the opposite way.

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Actually,
what is implicit in this

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
explanation is that I am
counting positively all the

161
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
stuff that flows across C in the
direction of n and negatively

162
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
what flows in the opposite
direction.

163
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What flows to the right of C,
well, across C from left to

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:47,000
right is counted positively.
While what flows right to left

165
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
is counted negatively.
So, in fact,

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it is the net flow through C
per unit time.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Any questions about the
definition or the interpretation

168
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or things like that?
Yes?

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, you can have both not in
the same small segment.

170
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it could be that,
well, imagine that my vector

171
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
field accidentally goes in the
opposite direction then this

172
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
part of the curve,
while things are flowing to the

173
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
left,
contributes negatively to flux.

174
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And here maybe the field is
tangent so the normal component

175
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
becomes zero.
And then it becomes positive

176
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and this part of the curve
contributes positively.

177
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
For example,
if you imagine that you have a

178
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
round tank in which the fluid is
rotating and you put your dam

179
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
just on a diameter across then
things are going one way on one

180
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
side,
the other way on the other

181
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
side,
and actually it just evens out.

182
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We don't have complete
information.

183
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It is just the total net flux.
OK.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If there are no other questions
then I guess we will need to

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
figure out how to compute this
guy and how to actually do this

186
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
line integral.
Well, let's start with a couple

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:43,000
of easy examples.
Let's say that C is a circle of

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:55,000
radius (a) centered at the
origin going counterclockwise.

189
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And let's say that our vector
field is xi yj.

190
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What does that look like?
Remember, xi plus yj is a

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
vector field that is pointing
radially away from the origin.

192
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because at every point it is
equal to the vector from the

193
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
origin to that point.
Now, if we have a circle and

194
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
let's say we are going
counterclockwise.

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, I have a nicer
picture.

196
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let me do it here.
That is my curve and my vector

197
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
field.
And the normal vector, see,

198
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
when you go counterclockwise in
a closed curve,

199
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
this convention that a normal
vector points to the right of

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
curve makes it point out.
The usual convention,

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
when you take flux for a closed
curve, is that you are counting

202
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the flux going out of the region
enclosed by the curve.

203
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And, of course,
if you went clockwise it would

204
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
be the other way around.
You choose to do it the way you

205
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,000
want, but the most common one is
to count flux going out of the

206
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
region.
Let's see what happens.

207
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, if I am anywhere on my
circle, see, the normal vector

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is sticking straight out of the
circle.

209
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That is a property of the
circle that the radial direction

210
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
is perpendicular to the circle.
Actually, let me complete this

211
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
picture.
If I take a point on the

212
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
circle, I have my normal vector
that is pointing straight out so

213
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it is parallel to F.
Along C we know that F is

214
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
parallel to n,
so F dot n will be equal to the

215
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
magnitude of F times,
well, the magnitude of n,

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but that is one.
Let me put it anywhere,

217
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but that is the unit normal
vector.

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Now, what is the magnitude of
this vector field if I am at a

219
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
point x, y?
Well, it is square root of x

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
squared plus y squared,
which is the same as the

221
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
distance from the origin.
So if this distance,

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:46,000
if this radius is a then the
magnitude of F will just be a.

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
In fact, F dot n is constant,
always equal to a.

224
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So the line integral will be
pretty easy because all I have

225
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to do is the integral of F dot n
ds becomes the integral of a ds.

226
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
(a) is a constant so I can take
it out.

227
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And integral ds is just a
length of C which is 2pi a,

228
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so I will get 2pi a squared.
And that is positive,

229
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
as we expected,
because stuff is flowing out of

230
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the circle.
Any questions about that?

231
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No.
OK.

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Just out of curiosity,
let's say that we had taken our

233
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
other favorite vector field.
Let's say that we had the same

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
C, but now the vector field
.

235
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Remember, that one goes
counterclockwise around the

236
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
origin.
If you remember what we did

237
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
several times,
well, along the circle that

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
vector field now is tangent to
the circle.

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If it is tangent to the circle
it doesn't have any normal

240
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
component.
The normal component is zero.

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Things are not flowing into the
circle or out of it.

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
They are just flowing along the
circle around and around so the

243
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
flux will be zero.
F now is tangent to C.

244
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:51,000
F dot n is zero and,
therefore, the flux will be

245
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
zero.
These are examples where you

246
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
can compute things
geometrically.

247
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I would say,
generally speaking,

248
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
with flux, well,
if it is a very complicated

249
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
field then you cannot.
But, if a field is fairly

250
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
simple,
you should be able to get some

251
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
general feeling for whether your
answer should be positive,

252
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
negative or zero just by
thinking about which way is my

253
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
flow going.
Is it going across the curve

254
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:32,000
one way or the other way?
Still no questions about these

255
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
examples?
The next thing we need to know

256
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is how we will actually compute
these things because here,

257
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
yeah, it works pretty well,
but what if you don't have a

258
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
simple geometric interpretation.
What if I give you a really

259
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
complicated curve and then you
have trouble finding the normal

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
vector?
It is going to be annoying to

261
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
set up things this way.
Actually, there is a better way

262
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
to do it in coordinates.
Just as we do work,

263
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
when we compute this line
integral, usually we don't do it

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
geometrically like this.
Most of the time we just

265
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
integrate M dx plus N dy in
coordinates.

266
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That is a similar way to do it
because it is,

267
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
again, a line integral so it
should work the same way.

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's try to figure that out.

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:24:05,000


270
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:22,000
How do we do the calculation in
coordinates, or I should say

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
using components?
That is the general method of

272
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
calculation when we don't have
something geometric to do.

273
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Remember, when we were doing
things for work we said this

274
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
vector dr, or if you prefer T
ds, we said just becomes

275
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
symbolically dx and dy.
When you do the line integral

276
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
of F dot dr you get line
integral of n dx plus n dy.

277
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Now let's think for a second
about how we would express n ds.

278
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Well, what is n ds compared to
T ds?

279
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, M is just T rotated by 90
degrees, so n ds is T ds rotated

280
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
by 90 degrees.
That might sound a little bit

281
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
outrageous because these are
really symbolic notations but it

282
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
works.
I am not going to spend too

283
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
much time trying to convince you
carefully.

284
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But if you go back to where we
wrote this and how we tried to

285
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
justify this and you work your
way through it,

286
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you will see that n ds can be
analyzed the same way.

287
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:51,000
N is T rotated 90 degrees
clockwise.

288
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That tells us that n ds is --
How do we rotate a vector by 90

289
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
degrees?
Well, we swept the two

290
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
components and we put a minus
sign.

291
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You have dy and dx.
And you have to be careful

292
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
where to put the minus sign.
Well, if you are doing it

293
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
clockwise, it is in front of dx.

294
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:26,000


295
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, actually,
let me just convince you

296
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
quickly.
Let's say we have a small piece

297
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
of C.
If we do T delta S,

298
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that is also vector delta r.
That is going to be just the

299
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
vector that goes along the curve
given by this.

300
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Its components will be indeed
the change in x,

301
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
delta x, and the change in y,
delta y.

302
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And now, if I want to get n
delta S, well,

303
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I claim now that it is
perfectly valid and rigorous to

304
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
just rotate that by 90 degrees.
If I want to rotate this by 90

305
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
degrees clockwise then the x
component will become the same

306
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
as the old y component.
And the y component will be

307
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
minus delta x.
Then you take the limit when

308
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the segment becomes shorter and
shorter, and that is how you can

309
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
justify this.
That is the key to computing

310
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
things in practice.
It means, actually,

311
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you already know how to compute
line integrals for flux.

312
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Let me just write it explicitly.
Let's say that our vector field

313
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
has two components.
And let me just confuse you a

314
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
little bit and not call them M
and N for this time just to

315
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
stress the fact that we are
doing a different line integral.

316
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let me call them P and Q for
now.

317
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Then the line integral of F dot
n ds will be the line integral

318
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
of
dot product .

319
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That will be the integral of -
Q dx P dy.

320
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Well, I am running out of space
here.

321
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It is integral along C of
negative Q dx plus P dy.

322
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And from that point onwards you
just do it the usual way.

323
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Remember, here you have two
variables x and y but you are

324
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
integrating along a curve.
If you are integrating along a

325
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
curve x and y are related.
They depend on each other or

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
maybe on some other parameter
like T or theta or whatever.

327
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You express everything in terms
of a single variable and then

328
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you do a usual single integral.
Any questions about that?

329
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I see a lot of confused faces
so maybe I shouldn't have called

330
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
my component P and Q.

331
00:29:41,000 --> 00:30:04,000


332
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:14,000
If you prefer,
if you are really sentimentally

333
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:27,000
attached to M and N then this
new line integral becomes the

334
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
integral of - N dx M dy.
If a problem tells you compute

335
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
flux instead of saying compute
work,

336
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the only thing you change is
instead of doing M dx plus N dy

337
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you do minus N dx plus M dy.
And I am sorry to say that I

338
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
don't have any good way of
helping you remember which one

339
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
of the two gets the minus sign,
so you just have to remember

340
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
this formula by heart.
That is the only way I know.

341
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, you can try to go through
this argument again,

342
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
but it is really best if you
just remember that formula.

343
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I am not going to do an example
because we already know how to

344
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
do line integrals.
Hopefully you will get to see

345
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
one at least in recitation on
Monday.

346
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That is all pretty good.
Let me tell you now what if I

347
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
have to compute flux along a
closed curve and I don't want to

348
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
compute it?
Well, remember in the case of

349
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
work we had Green's theorem.
We saw yesterday Green's

350
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
theorem.
Let's us replace a line

351
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
integral along a closed curve by
a double integral.

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, here it is the same.
We have a line integral along a

353
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
curve.
If it is a closed curve,

354
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
we should be able to replace it
by a double integral.

355
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There is a version of Green's
theorem for flux.

356
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And you will see it is not
scarier than the other one.

357
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It is perhaps less scarier or
perhaps just as scary or just

358
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
not as scary,
depending on how you feel about

359
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
it, but it works pretty much the
same way.

360
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What does Green's theorem for
flux say?

361
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It says if C is a curve that
encloses a region R

362
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:51,000
counterclockwise and if I have a
vector field that is defined

363
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
everywhere,
not just on C but also inside,

364
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:11,000
so also on R.
Well, maybe I should give names

365
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
to the components.
If you will forgive me for a

366
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
second, I will still use P and Q
for now.

367
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You will see why.
It is defined and

368
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
differentiable in R.
Then I can actually -- --

369
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
replace the line integral for
flux by a double integral over R

370
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
of some function.
And that function is called the

371
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:58,000
divergence of F dA.
This is the divergence of F.

372
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I have to define for you
what this guy is.

373
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The divergence of a vector
field with components P and Q is

374
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
just P sub x Q sub y.
This one is actually easier to

375
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
remember than curl because you
just take the x component,

376
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
take its partial with respect
to x,

377
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
take the y component,
take its partial with respect

378
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to y and add them together.
No signs.

379
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No switching things around.
This one is pretty

380
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
straightforward.
The picture again is if I have

381
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
my curve C going
counterclockwise around a region

382
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
R and I want to find the flux of
some vector field F that is

383
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
everywhere in here.
Maybe some parts of C will

384
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
contribute positively and some
parts will contribute

385
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
negatively.
Just to reiterate what I said,

386
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
positively here means,
because we are going

387
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
counterclockwise,
the normal vector points out of

388
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:31,000
the region.
This guy here is the flux out

389
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of R through C.
That is the formula.

390
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Any questions about what the
statement says or how to use it

391
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
concretely?
No.

392
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OK.
It is pretty similar to Green's

393
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
theorem for work.
Actually, I should say -- This

394
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:07,000
is called Green's theorem in
normal form also.

395
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Not that the other one is
abnormal, but just that the old

396
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
one for work was,
you could say,

397
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in tangential form.
That just means,

398
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
well, Green's theorem,
as seen yesterday was for the

399
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
line integral F dot T ds,
integrating the tangent

400
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
component of F.
The one today is for

401
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
integrating the normal component
of F.

402
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK. Let's prove this.
Good news.

403
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It is much easier to prove than
the one we did yesterday because

404
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
we are just going to show that
it is the same thing just using

405
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
different notations.

406
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:23,000


407
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
How do I prove it?
Well, maybe actually it would

408
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
help if first,
before proving it,

409
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I actually rewrite what it
means in components.

410
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We said the line integral of F
dot n ds is actually the line

411
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
integral of - Q dx P dy.
And we want to show that this

412
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:03,000
is equal to the double integral
of P sub x Q sub y dA.

413
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This is really one of the
features of Green's theorem.

414
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
No matter which form it is,
it relates a line integral to a

415
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
double integral.
Let's just try to see if we can

416
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
reduce it to the one we had
yesterday.

417
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Let me forget what these things
mean physically and just focus

418
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
on the math.
On the math it is a line

419
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
integral of something dx plus
something dy.

420
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's call this guy M and let's
call this guy N.

421
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Let M equal negative Q and N
equal P.

422
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Then this guy here becomes
integral of M dx plus N dy.

423
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And I know from yesterday what
this is equal to,

424
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
namely using the tangential
form of Green's theorem.

425
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Green for work.
This is the double integral of

426
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
curl of this guy.
That is Nx minus My dA.

427
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But now let's think about what
this is in terms of M and N.

428
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Well, we said that M is
negative Q so this is negative

429
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
My.
And we said P is the same as N,

430
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
so this is Nx.
Just by renaming the

431
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
components, I go from one form
to the other one.

432
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So it is really the same
theorem.

433
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That's why it is also called
Green's theorem.

434
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But the way we think about it
when we use it is different,

435
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
because one of them computes
the work done by a force along a

436
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
closed curve,
the other one computes the flux

437
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
maybe of a velocity field out of
region.

438
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Questions?
Yes?

439
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That is correct.
If you are trying to compute a

440
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
line integral for flux,
wait, where did I put it?

441
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
A line integral for flux just
becomes this.

442
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And once you are here you know
how to compute that kind of

443
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
thing.
The double integral side does

444
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
not even have any kind of
renaming to do.

445
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know how to compute a
double integral of a function.

446
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
This is just a particular kind
of function that you get out of

447
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
a vector field,
but it is like any function.

448
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The way you would evaluate
these double integrals is just

449
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the usual way.
Namely, you have a function of

450
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
x and y, you have a region and
you set up the bounds for the

451
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
isolated integral.
The way you would evaluate the

452
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
double integrals is really the
usual way,

453
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
by slicing the region and
setting up the bounds for

454
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
iterated integrals in dx,
dy or dydx or maybe rd,

455
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
rd theta or whatever you want.
In fact, in terms of computing

456
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
integrals, we just have two sets
of skills.

457
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
One is setting up and
evaluating double integrals.

458
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The other one is setting up and
evaluating line integrals.

459
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And whether these line
integrals or double integrals

460
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
are representing work,
flux, integral of a curve,

461
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
whatever,
the way that we actually

462
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
compute them is the same.
Let's do an example.

463
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, first. Sorry.
This renaming here, see,

464
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
that is why actually I call my
components P and Q because the

465
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
argument would have gotten very
messy if I had told you now I

466
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
call M ,N and I call N minus M
and so on.

467
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But, now that we are through
with this,

468
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
if you still like M and N
better,

469
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:15,000
you know, what this says -- The
formulation of Green's theorem

470
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:27,000
in this language is just
integral of minus N dx plus M dy

471
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is the double integral over R of
Mx plus Ny dA.

472
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Now let's do an example.
Let's look at this picture

473
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:51,000
again, the flux of xi plus yj
out of the circle of radius A.

474
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We did the calculation directly
using geometry,

475
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and it wasn't all that bad.
But let's see what Green's

476
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
theorem does for us here.

477
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:19,000


478
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Example.
Let's take the same example as

479
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
last time.
F equals xi yj.

480
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:43,000
C equals circle of radius a
counterclockwise.

481
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
How do we set up Green's
theorem.

482
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Well, let's first figure out
the divergence of F.

483
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The divergence of this field,
I take the x component,

484
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
which is x, and I take its
partial respect to x.

485
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And then I do the same with the
y component, and I will get one

486
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
plus one equals two.
So, the divergence of this

487
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
field is two.
Now, Green's theorem tells us

488
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that the flux out of this region
is going to be the double

489
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
integral of 2 dA.
What is R now?

490
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, R is the region enclosed
by C.

491
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So if C is the circle,
R is the disk of radius A.

492
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Of course, we can compute it,
but we don't have to because

493
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
double integral of 2dA is just
twice the double integral of dA

494
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
so it is twice the area of R.
And we know the area of a

495
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
circle of radius A.
That is piA2.

496
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So, it is 2piA2.
That is the same answer that we

497
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
got directly,
which is good news.

498
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Now we can even do better.
Let's say that my circle is not

499
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
at the origin.
Let's say that it is out here.

500
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Well, then it becomes harder to
calculate the flux directly.

501
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And it is harder even to guess
exactly what will happen because

502
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
on this side here the vector
field will go into the region so

503
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
the contribution to flux will be
negative here.

504
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Here it will be positive
because it is going out of the

505
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
region.
There are positive and negative

506
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
terms.
Well, it looks like positive

507
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
should win because here the
vector field is much larger than

508
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
over there.
But, short of computing it,

509
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
we won't actually know what it
is.

510
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
If you want to do it by direct
calculation then you have to

511
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
parametize this circle and
figure out what the line

512
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
integral will be.
But if you use Green's theorem,

513
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
well, we never used the fact
that it is the circle of radius

514
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
A at the origin.
It is true actually for any

515
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
closed curve that the flux out
of it is going to be twice the

516
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
area of the region inside.
It still will be 2piA2 even if

517
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
my circle is anywhere else in
the plane.

518
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
If I had asked you a trick
question where do you want to

519
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
place this circle so that that
the flux is the largest?

520
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Well, the answer is it doesn't
matter.

521
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Now, let's just finish quickly
by answering a question that

522
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
some of you,
I am sure, must have,

523
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
which is what does divergence
mean and what does it measure?

524
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean, we said for curl,
curl measures how much things

525
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
are rotating somehow.
What does divergence mean?

526
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, the answer is divergence
measures how much things are

527
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:08,000
diverging.
Let's be more explicit.

528
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Interpretation of divergence.
You can think of it,

529
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
you know, what do I want to say
first?

530
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
If you take a vector field that
is a constant vector field where

531
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
everything just translates then
there is no divergence involved

532
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
because the derivatives will be
zero.

533
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
If you take the guy that
rotates things around you will

534
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
also compute and find zero for
divergence.

535
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This is not sensitive to
translation motions where

536
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
everything moves together or to
rotation motions,

537
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
but instead it is sensitive to
explaining motions.

538
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:04,000
A possible answer is that it
measures how much the flow is

539
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
expanding areas.
If you imagine this flow that

540
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
we have here on the picture,
things are moving away from the

541
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
origin and they fill out the
plane.

542
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
If we mention this fluid
flowing out there,

543
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
it is occupying more and more
space.

544
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And so that is what it means to
have positive divergence.

545
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
If you took the opposite vector
field that contracts everything

546
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
to the origin that will have
negative divergence.

547
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That is a good way to think
about it if you are thinking of

548
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
a gas maybe that can expand to
fill out more volume.

549
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
If you thinking of water,
well, water doesn't really

550
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
shrink or expand.
The fact that it is taking more

551
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and more space actually means
that there is more and more

552
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
water.
The other way to think about it

553
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is divergence is the source
rate,

554
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
it is the amount of fluid that
is being inserted into the

555
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:12,000
system,
that is being pumped into the

556
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:27,000
system per unit time per unit
area.

557
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
What div F equals two here
means is that here you actually

558
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
have matter being created or
being pumped into the system so

559
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that you have more and more
water filling more and more

560
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
space as it flows.
But, actually,

561
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
divergence is not two just at
the origin.

562
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It is two everywhere.
So, in fact,

563
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
to have this you need to have a
system of pumps that actually is

564
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
in something water absolutely
everywhere uniformly.

565
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That is the only way to do this.
I mean if you imagine that you

566
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
just have one spring at the
origin then,

567
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
sure, water will flow out,
but as you go further and

568
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
further away it will do so more
and more slowly.

569
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Well, here it is flowing away
faster and faster.

570
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And that means everywhere you
are still pumping more water

571
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
into it.
So, that is what divergence

572
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
measures.

573
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000

And so today we are going to go</span> <span m="33000">over the second half of the class very quickly.</span> <span m="38000">And so that was stuff about double and triple integrals and</span> <span m="45000">vector calculus in the plane and in space.</span> <span m="51000">As usual, what is on the final is basically what was on the</span> <span m="55000">other tests, exactly the same stuff.</span> <span m="57000">Well, not the same problem, unfortunately.</span> <span m="63000">The first thing we learned about was double integrals in</span> <span m="73000">the plane and how to set up the bounds and how to evaluate them.</span> <span m="85000">Just to remind you quickly, the important thing with</span> <span m="90000">iterated integrals is when you integrate a function f of x,</span> <span m="94000">y, say dy dx for example,</span> <span m="98000">is that you have to draw a picture of a region.</span> <span m="101000">Unless it is completely obvious you should really draw some</span> <span m="105000">picture of the domain of integration.</span> <span m="108000">And once you have that picture you can use it to find the</span> <span m="113000">bounds. Remember the general method is</span> <span m="117000">that we first look at the inner integral, here integral of f dy.</span> <span m="123000">And in this inner integral the outer variable here,</span> <span m="127000">x, is fixed. That means we are slicing our</span> <span m="130000">region by a vertical line corresponding to a fixed value</span> <span m="133000">of x. We fix a value of x.</span> <span m="136000">And what we have to find out is the bounds for y,</span> <span m="140000">so the value of y at this point, the value of y at that</span> <span m="144000">point. Let me call that y some bottom</span> <span m="148000">of x, in general depends on x. And this one will be y at that</span> <span m="154000">top, and it also depends on x. And then the bounds for y would</span> <span m="163000">be this. And then, when you look at the</span> <span m="166000">outer bound, things are different.</span> <span m="168000">Because there you expect to have just numbers,</span> <span m="171000">no longer functions of anything.</span> <span m="173000">And what you do is look at the shadow of your region.</span> <span m="176000">We are doing it by shadow so you just project to the x-axis.</span> <span m="180000">If you project to the x-axis your region will look like this.</span> <span m="184000">Its shadow is going to be this integral form,</span> <span m="188000">some minimum value of x to some maximum value of x.</span> <span m="192000">And that will give us the bounds for the outer integral.</span> <span m="204000">And then, to evaluate, we evaluate the usual way.</span> <span m="207000">Speaking of evaluation, what you need to know for the</span> <span m="209000">final, well, essentially the same kind</span> <span m="211000">of evaluation techniques that we were supposed to know for the</span> <span m="215000">other tests. That means the usual functions,</span> <span m="220000">substitutions, basic trig, stuff like that.</span> <span m="227000">Well, I don't expect that you would need integration by parts,</span> <span m="231000">although I still hope that some of you remember it from single</span> <span m="234000">variable calculus. If there is a need to integrate</span> <span m="239000">some big power of cosine or sine then the formula will be given</span> <span m="246000">to you the way it is in the notes.</span> <span m="251000">And, of course, we know also how to set up</span> <span m="257000">these integrals in polar coordinates.</span> <span m="263000">And then the area element becomes r dr d theta.</span> <span m="268000">And because you integrate first over r,</span> <span m="272000">well, first of all you should remember the polar coordinate</span> <span m="276000">formulas, namely x equals r cosine theta</span> <span m="282000">and y equals r sine theta. And second you should remember</span> <span m="290000">that what we do, when we have our region,</span> <span m="293000">is for a fixed value of theta we look for the bounds for r,</span> <span m="296000">just like before, so the way we are slicing the</span> <span m="299000">region is now we are actually shooting rays straight from the</span> <span m="302000">origin. And, in a given direction,</span> <span m="304000">we are asking ourselves how far does my region go?</span> <span m="308000">You have to find a bound and you have to find whatever the</span> <span m="312000">value of r will be out here as a function of theta.</span> <span m="315000">And ways to do that can be geometric or they can be by</span> <span m="319000">starting from the x, y equation of whatever curve</span> <span m="322000">you have and then expressing it in terms of r and theta and</span> <span m="326000">solving for r. For example,</span> <span m="328000">just to illustrate it, we have seen that one of our</span> <span m="333000">classics has been the circle of radius one centered at one,</span> <span m="339000">zero. This guy, you have two</span> <span m="342000">different ways of getting its polar coordinate equation.</span> <span m="345000">One is to argue geometrically that you have a right angle in</span> <span m="349000">here. And this length is two,</span> <span m="351000">this angle is theta, this length is r,</span> <span m="354000">so the polar equation is r equals two cosine theta.</span> <span m="359000">The other way to do it, if somehow you are missing the</span> <span m="361000">geometric trick, is to start from the x,</span> <span m="363000">y equation. What is the x,</span> <span m="365000">y equation of this guy? Well, it is x minus one squared</span> <span m="370000">plus y squared equals one. If you expand that you will get</span> <span m="376000">x squared minus two x plus one plus y squared equals one.</span> <span m="382000">The ones simplify. X squared plus y squared</span> <span m="387000">becomes r squared minus two x becomes r cosine theta equals</span> <span m="394000">zero. That gives you,</span> <span m="396000">when you simplify by r, r equals two cosine theta.</span> <span m="400000">Two ways to get the same polar equation.</span> <span m="409000">I should say this is an example, in case you were</span> <span m="413000">wondering what I was doing. We have also actually seen how</span> <span m="421000">to change variables to more complicated coordinate systems.</span> <span m="434000">Let's say u, v coordinates. But, of course,</span> <span m="436000">you can call them whatever you want.</span> <span m="440000">The main thing to remember is that you have to look for the</span> <span m="444000">Jacobian which will give you the conversion ratio between dx dy</span> <span m="450000">and du dv. For example,</span> <span m="452000">if you know u and v as functions of x and y then you</span> <span m="456000">will write du dv equals absolute value of the Jacobian partial u,</span> <span m="462000">v over partial x, y times dx dy. Or, if it is easier for you,</span> <span m="470000">you can do the Jacobian the other way around.</span> <span m="472000">And this Jacobian, remember, is the determinant by</span> <span m="476000">a two by two matrix that you obtain by putting the partial</span> <span m="480000">derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y.</span> <span m="483000">Then, when we have that, we can change the integrant,</span> <span m="488000">f of x, y, into something involving u and v possibly.</span> <span m="493000">And then we have to find the bounds.</span> <span m="495000">And to find the bounds perhaps the easiest is to draw a picture</span> <span m="499000">of a region in u, v coordinates.</span> <span m="501000">Maybe you have some picture in the x,</span> <span m="504000">y plane that might actually be really hard to draw and maybe in</span> <span m="508000">terms of u and v the picture will become much simpler.</span> <span m="512000">It might just become a rectangle.</span> <span m="515000">Of course, if you see immediately what the bounds are</span> <span m="517000">in terms of u and v, and they turn out to be very</span> <span m="519000">easy, then maybe you don't even have</span> <span m="521000">to draw this picture. But if it is not completely</span> <span m="525000">obvious then that might be a helpful way of figuring out what</span> <span m="529000">the bounds will be when you switch from x,</span> <span m="532000">y to u, v. We have seen some problems like</span> <span m="535000">that and there are more in the notes in case you need more.</span> <span m="540000">Questions? Yes?</span> <span m="547000">That is the second time you've asked for something real quick</span> <span m="550000">in these review sessions. You are in a hurry.</span> <span m="553000">Take your time. Partial u, v over partial x,</span> <span m="563000">y is just going to be the determinant of u sub x,</span> <span m="566000">u sub y, v sub x, v sub y.</span> <span m="569000">That is the definition. That is pretty direct.</span> <span m="577000">And, of course, a general common sense thing</span> <span m="579000">that applies to actually all the integrals that we are going to</span> <span m="583000">see, there are two things in an integral.</span> <span m="585000">One is whatever you integral is called the integrant.</span> <span m="589000">It could be a function here. It is a vector field in some of</span> <span m="592000">the flux things and so on. There is another thing which is</span> <span m="595000">the region over which you integrate.</span> <span m="597000">And the two have strictly nothing to do with each other.</span> <span m="602000">When you are given a piece of data in the statement of a</span> <span m="605000">problem, you have to figure out whether</span> <span m="607000">that is part of a function to be integrated or whether that is</span> <span m="609000">part of the region of integration.</span> <span m="611000">If it is the region of integration then it will go into</span> <span m="614000">the bounds of the integral and maybe in the choice of the</span> <span m="617000">coordinate system that you use for integrating.</span> <span m="619000">While the function that you are integrating goes before the dx</span> <span m="623000">dy and not into the bounds or anything like that.</span> <span m="626000">I know it sounds kind of silly but it is a good safety check.</span> <span m="632000">Ask yourselves, when you have a piece of data,</span> <span m="634000">where in my formula should this go.</span> <span m="636000">Yes? I case you want the bounds for</span> <span m="647000">this region in polar coordinates, indeed it would be</span> <span m="650000">double integral. For a fixed theta,</span> <span m="653000">r goes from zero to whatever it is on that curve.</span> <span m="657000">So it would be zero to two cosine theta of whatever the</span> <span m="664000">function is r dr d theta. And the bounds on theta would</span> <span m="670000">be from negative pi over two to pi over two.</span> <span m="675000">We have seen that one several times, so hopefully by now it is</span> <span m="680000">clearer. OK.</span> <span m="681000">Let me move on a bit because we have a lot of other kinds of</span> <span m="688000">integrals to see. Other kinds of integrals we</span> <span m="692000">have seen are triple integrals. And I am not doing things in</span> <span m="695000">the order that we did them in the class just so you can see</span> <span m="699000">parallels between stuff in the plane and in space.</span> <span m="703000">When we do triple integrals in space, well, it is the same kind</span> <span m="707000">of story, except now we have, of course, more coordinate</span> <span m="710000">systems. We have rectangular</span> <span m="713000">coordinates, we have cylindrical coordinates and we have</span> <span m="719000">spherical coordinates. And cylindrical coordinates</span> <span m="725000">only mean that we are, instead of x, y and z,</span> <span m="729000">we are replacing x and y by the polar coordinate in the x,</span> <span m="735000">y plane, so the angle theta and the</span> <span m="737000">distance r. So R is somehow the distance</span> <span m="741000">from the z-axis and z is the height.</span> <span m="744000">Usually you don't have to choose between rectangular and</span> <span m="748000">cylindrical until somewhat late in the process,</span> <span m="751000">especially if you integrate first of all z,</span> <span m="753000">because then the choice will come up mostly when you try to</span> <span m="756000">figure out what are the bounds for the shadow of your region.</span> <span m="759000">I mean the z part looks exactly the same in rectangular and in</span> <span m="763000">cylindrical. Spherical is,</span> <span m="765000">on the other hand, a little bit more annoying</span> <span m="769000">because it looks quite different.</span> <span m="772000">You should think of it as doing polar coordinates not only in</span> <span m="776000">the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction</span> <span m="779000">at the same time. You have this angle phi.</span> <span m="782000">That measures the angle down from the positive z-axis.</span> <span m="786000">And you have rho which is the distance from the origin.</span> <span m="790000">And if I project to the z-axis, r becomes rho sine phi and z</span> <span m="799000">becomes rho cosine phi. I hope that you all know these</span> <span m="804000">two formulas, but if you ever have a small</span> <span m="807000">somehow memory lapse during the final then you should consider</span> <span m="811000">drawing this kind of picture because it will let you check</span> <span m="815000">very quickly which one is sine, which one is cosine.</span> <span m="822000">Now, of course, we have to have formulas for dv</span> <span m="824000">in all these coordinate systems. Here, for example,</span> <span m="827000">that might be dz r dr d theta or r dr d theta dz or anything</span> <span m="832000">like that. Here it might be rho squared</span> <span m="838000">times phi times d rho d phi d theta.</span> <span m="844000">And the general method for setting up bounds is pretty much</span> <span m="847000">the same as in the plane, just there is one more step.</span> <span m="850000">If you are doing rectangular or cylindrical coordinates with z</span> <span m="854000">first, for example, that is the most common.</span> <span m="856000">Well, if you do z first then you have to actually start by</span> <span m="862000">figuring out for a given value of x and y or r and theta what</span> <span m="868000">is the portion of a vertical line above x,</span> <span m="871000">y that lies within my region? That will go from z on the</span> <span m="877000">bottom of my solid which depends on x and y to z at the top of my</span> <span m="884000">solid which also usually will depend on x and y.</span> <span m="889000">And so that will give me the bounds for dz.</span> <span m="892000">And then I will be left with the shadow of my region in the</span> <span m="896000">x, y plane. And that one I will set up like</span> <span m="902000">a double integral over there. Strictly-speaking,</span> <span m="909000">if you are curious, we could also change to weird</span> <span m="912000">coordinate systems using Jacobian with three variables at</span> <span m="915000">the same time. But we haven't seen that so it</span> <span m="918000">won't be on the final. But it would work just the same</span> <span m="924000">way, just with more pictures to do.</span> <span m="930000">And, in fact, I just wanted to say this rho</span> <span m="933000">squared sine phi is actually the Jacobian for the change of</span> <span m="937000">variables for rectangular to spherical coordinates.</span> <span m="942000">OK. Let's not think too much about</span> <span m="948000">that. Applications.</span> <span m="951000">Well, we have seen how to use double integrals to find the</span> <span m="957000">area of a volume of a piece of a plane or a piece of space,</span> <span m="963000">and find also the mass. Remember, area is just double</span> <span m="968000">integral of one dA, volume is triple integral of</span> <span m="972000">one dV. Sometimes if it's the volume</span> <span m="974000">between the x, y plane and the graph of some</span> <span m="976000">function, you can just set it up directly as a double integral.</span> <span m="979000">But there is no harm in doing it as a triple integral if you</span> <span m="983000">feel better about that. And mass will be double or</span> <span m="987000">triple integral, depending on how many</span> <span m="991000">dimensions you have, of whatever density function</span> <span m="996000">you have, dA or dV. Then there is how to find the</span> <span m="1005000">average value of some function. Well, let me do the</span> <span m="1013000">three-dimensional case. You will just replace volume by</span> <span m="1018000">area and dV by dA and so on, if need be.</span> <span m="1022000">That would be one over volume of the solid times the triple</span> <span m="1029000">integral of f dV, or if it's a weighted average,</span> <span m="1038000">one over mass times the triple integral of a function times</span> <span m="1044000">density times dV. If you don't have a density or</span> <span m="1053000">if the density is constant then that reduces to that one.</span> <span m="1064000">In particular, we have seen the notion of</span> <span m="1066000">center of mass. The center of mass is just</span> <span m="1070000">given by taking the average values of the coordinates,</span> <span m="1074000">x bar, y bar, z bar.</span> <span m="1076000">It is just this formula but taking x, y or z as the</span> <span m="1080000">function. There are moments of inertia.</span> <span m="1088000">For example, the moment of inertia about the</span> <span m="1092000">z-axis is the triple integral of x squared plus y squared density</span> <span m="1097000">dV. Or, if you have just a</span> <span m="1099000">two-dimensional object, it is the same formula,</span> <span m="1102000">but, of course, with dA.</span> <span m="1103000">And then we call that the polar moment of inertia because we</span> <span m="1106000">thought of it as rotating the plane about the origin,</span> <span m="1110000">but the origin is just where the z-axis hits the x,</span> <span m="1114000">y plane so it is really the same thing.</span> <span m="1118000">And we have also seen gravitational attraction in</span> <span m="1122000">space, and I will let you look at your notes for that.</span> <span m="1127000">It is just one formula to remember.</span> <span m="1137000">Questions about iterated integrals, things like that?</span> <span m="1142000">Yes? The formula that you should</span> <span m="1158000">know for gravitational attraction is that if yu have a</span> <span m="1162000">point mass at the origin and you have some solid centered on the</span> <span m="1168000">z-axis that is attracting it then the force will be given by</span> <span m="1173000">G times the mass times the triple integral of density times</span> <span m="1178000">cosine phi over rho squared times dV.</span> <span m="1182000">And, of course, you will actually do that in</span> <span m="1185000">spherical coordinates because it is easier that way.</span> <span m="1190000">That is the formula I have in mind.</span> <span m="1195000">But, see, all these formulas just give you examples of things</span> <span m="1199000">to integrate. And how to set up the bounds</span> <span m="1201000">and so on does not depend on what you are actually</span> <span m="1203000">integrating. It is done always using the</span> <span m="1208000">same methods. Let's move on to work and line</span> <span m="1222000">integrals. We have seen how to do that in</span> <span m="1228000">the plane and in space. And it looks very similar</span> <span m="1235000">somehow. Remember, you have to know how</span> <span m="1241000">to set up and evaluate a line integral of this form.</span> <span m="1248000">Let me do it in the plane this time.</span> <span m="1249000">If you are in the plane you have two components,</span> <span m="1253000">and then this becomes the line integral of M dx plus N dy.</span> <span m="1258000">If you have a space curve then you will have a third component</span> <span m="1261000">here. You will add that guy times dz.</span> <span m="1265000">Now, how do we evaluate that? Well, it is very different from</span> <span m="1268000">there because here we are just on a curve so there should be</span> <span m="1271000">only one degree of freedom. One variable should be enough</span> <span m="1275000">to know where we are. We will have to express x and y</span> <span m="1281000">in terms of -- Well, I should and z optionally if</span> <span m="1288000">there is one, in terms of a single</span> <span m="1292000">parameters. And that might be just one of</span> <span m="1296000">the coordinates. If you are told y equals z</span> <span m="1298000">squared, that is easy. You just substitute y equals x</span> <span m="1301000">squared and dy equals two x dx into everything,</span> <span m="1304000">and you are left with an integral over x.</span> <span m="1308000">Maybe it will be something in terms of time or in terms of an</span> <span m="1321000">angle. We express everything in terms</span> <span m="1325000">of a single parameter, and that will give us a usual</span> <span m="1329000">single integral. Any questions about that?</span> <span m="1334000">Yes? If you cannot parameterize the</span> <span m="1343000">curve then it is really, really hard to evaluate the</span> <span m="1347000">line integral. Well, you might be able to</span> <span m="1351000">evaluate it numerically into a computer, but that is the</span> <span m="1355000">easiest way to describe a curve. Indeed it could be that in the</span> <span m="1360000">plane you have an equation in terms of x and y given by some</span> <span m="1363000">completed formulas defining some curve.</span> <span m="1366000">Then actually there are ways you can use basically</span> <span m="1369000">differentials and constrained partials to figure out what the</span> <span m="1372000">tangent vector to the curve is and so on.</span> <span m="1375000">But we haven't really seen how to do that.</span> <span m="1377000">That would be a really nice topic for tying together the end</span> <span m="1380000">of the second unit that we discussed last time,</span> <span m="1382000">constrained partials, with this stuff.</span> <span m="1384000">But that is not going to be part of our topics.</span> <span m="1388000">Basically, all the curves we have seen in this class,</span> <span m="1391000">there is a way to express the position of a point in terms of</span> <span m="1394000">a parameter. We haven't seen any curves that</span> <span m="1403000">are so complicated that you cannot do that.</span> <span m="1414000">The other thing we have seen is that there are some special</span> <span m="1417000">cases of vector fields where we don't actually have to compute</span> <span m="1420000">this thing because maybe we know that it is the gradient of some</span> <span m="1423000">potential function. And then we have a fundamental</span> <span m="1428000">theorem that gives us a way to compute this without computing</span> <span m="1435000">it. We've seen about gradient</span> <span m="1444000">fields and path independence. The thing to check is whether</span> <span m="1456000">the curl of our vector field is zero.</span> <span m="1458000">And remember in the plane that is one condition,</span> <span m="1467000">Nx equals My. In 3D in space that is actually</span> <span m="1473000">three conditions because you have to check all the mixed</span> <span m="1479000">partials of the various components.</span> <span m="1484000">If the curl of f is zero that tells us we are likely to have a</span> <span m="1487000">gradient field. Strictly-speaking,</span> <span m="1492000">I should mention and F is defined in a simply-connected</span> <span m="1506000">region. Then F is a gradient field.</span> <span m="1516000">That means that we can find a potential function.</span> <span m="1525000">You can write F as the gradient of little f for some potential</span> <span m="1530000">function little f. And we have seen how to find</span> <span m="1539000">the potential. In fact, we have seen two</span> <span m="1546000">methods for that. And we have seen them twice.</span> <span m="1550000">We have seen them once for functions of two variables,</span> <span m="1553000">once for functions of three variables.</span> <span m="1555000">They look very much the same. I encourage you to compare your</span> <span m="1558000">notes for the two side by side to see where they differ.</span> <span m="1563000">Where they differ, roughly-speaking,</span> <span m="1565000">well, I never know if it is the first or the second,</span> <span m="1569000">but one of the two methods was to compute a line integral.</span> <span m="1574000">In the plane, what we did is we set up and</span> <span m="1578000">evaluated a line integral along our favorite path from the</span> <span m="1583000">origin to a point with coordinates say x1,</span> <span m="1587000">y1. And then we had to evaluate the</span> <span m="1592000">line integral for the work done along this path.</span> <span m="1598000">And that will give us the value of potential at that point.</span> <span m="1603000">If we are doing it with three variables, that method remains</span> <span m="1606000">very similar. The only difference is now we</span> <span m="1609000">have to go also up in space to some point x1,</span> <span m="1612000">y1, z1. And so we actually sum three</span> <span m="1615000">pieces together. But on each piece it is the</span> <span m="1619000">same story, only one variable changes.</span> <span m="1621000">Here it is only x that changes, it is only y that changes,</span> <span m="1626000">and on the third one only z would be changing.</span> <span m="1631000">That is one possibility. And the other possibility for</span> <span m="1638000">finding the potential is that we start with the condition that</span> <span m="1643000">the first component of our vector field should be equal to</span> <span m="1648000">f sub x for the unknown potential function.</span> <span m="1652000">What we do is integrate with respect to x,</span> <span m="1656000">and we will get our potential function up to an integration</span> <span m="1660000">constant. And that integration constant</span> <span m="1664000">typically depends on the remaining variables that might</span> <span m="1668000">be y or equal in space y and z. And then what we have to do is</span> <span m="1673000">take the partial of this with respect to y and compare it to</span> <span m="1676000">what we want it to be, namely the y component of a</span> <span m="1680000">vector field, and match them to get some</span> <span m="1682000">information about this guy. And if we have three variables</span> <span m="1688000">then there is a third step because there you will still</span> <span m="1693000">have an unknown function of z that you need to get by</span> <span m="1698000">comparing the partials with respect to z.</span> <span m="1703000">I see a lot of very quiet faces somehow.</span> <span m="1710000">Well, hopefully that is because you know that stuff.</span> <span m="1716000">If it is because you are hopelessly confused then please</span> <span m="1722000">review a lot before the final, but I really hope that is not</span> <span m="1729000">the case. And so,</span> <span m="1762000">in particular, what we have seen is once we</span> <span m="1766000">have the potential then we can use the fundamental theorem of</span> <span m="1772000">calculus to tell us that if we have a line integral to compute</span> <span m="1778000">for work along a curve that goes from some point P zero to some</span> <span m="1784000">point P one then the line integral for the work done by</span> <span m="1789000">gradient F is actually going just to be the change in value</span> <span m="1794000">of a potential. And, in particular,</span> <span m="1798000">that does not depend on how we got from P zero to P one.</span> <span m="1802000">That is why we say that we have path independence.</span> <span m="1810000">Next topic is flux in plane and space.</span> <span m="1822000">Flux looks quite different in the plane and in space because,</span> <span m="1826000">in the plane, it is just another kind of line</span> <span m="1829000">integral, while in space it is a surface</span> <span m="1832000">integral. If you were in four-dimensional</span> <span m="1834000">space it would be a triple integral.</span> <span m="1835000">Generally, you do flux for something that is somehow a wall</span> <span m="1843000">that separates regions of space from each other.</span> <span m="1850000">In the plane, the way we do it is we have a</span> <span m="1856000">curve C and we look at its tangent vector,</span> <span m="1862000">let's call that T, and we rotate it by 90 degrees</span> <span m="1869000">clockwise. That is our convention to get a</span> <span m="1873000">unit normal vector that points to the right of the curve as we</span> <span m="1878000">move along the curve. That is our convention for</span> <span m="1881000">orienting curves. And we are always going to be</span> <span m="1884000">using that one. N equals T rotated 90 degrees</span> <span m="1893000">clockwise. In particular,</span> <span m="1897000">that means that n ds, which will be what we integrate</span> <span m="1904000">against when we try to compute flux, will just end up being dy,</span> <span m="1912000">negative dx. Concretely, when we have to</span> <span m="1918000">evaluate a line integral of F dot n ds,</span> <span m="1923000">geometrically we could try to take the dot product of our</span> <span m="1927000">field with the normal vector and then sum the length element</span> <span m="1931000">along the curve. And, in some cases,</span> <span m="1934000">for example, if you know that the vector</span> <span m="1936000">field is tangent to the curve or if a dot product is constant or</span> <span m="1939000">things like that then that might actually give you a very easy</span> <span m="1942000">answer. But, in general,</span> <span m="1944000">the most efficient way to do it will be to say that if your</span> <span m="1948000">vector field has components, I don't know,</span> <span m="1951000">let's call them P and Q, then that will be just the line</span> <span m="1956000">integral of PQ dot dy, negative dx,</span> <span m="1959000">which means negative Q dx plus P dy.</span> <span m="1964000">And, from that point onward, you evaluate it exactly the</span> <span m="1969000">same way as you would for a work integral.</span> <span m="1974000">But, of course, the geometric meaning is very</span> <span m="1976000">different. It is the same meaning that we</span> <span m="1977000">have always seen for flux. It measures how much a vector</span> <span m="1988000">field goes across the curve. Now, if we are in space then</span> <span m="2002000">you take flux for a surface, not for a curve.</span> <span m="2010000">And the way it will work is that you have to choose an</span> <span m="2013000">orientation of a surface, which just means choosing one</span> <span m="2017000">of the two possible unit normal vectors.</span> <span m="2020000">And then you will do a surface integral for F dot n dS.</span> <span m="2031000">That is the surface i element. The setup for this surface</span> <span m="2040000">integral is that first we have to express n and dS in some way.</span> <span m="2047000">One possibility is that we can express the normal vector n dS</span> <span m="2054000">geometrically. That is, for example,</span> <span m="2058000">what we do when we look at, say, a horizontal plane or a</span> <span m="2063000">vertical plane or a sphere or a cylinder.</span> <span m="2067000">Then we have some geometric idea of why the normal vector is</span> <span m="2071000">what it is and we have some formula for dS.</span> <span m="2074000">Or, we can use one of the standard formulas.</span> <span m="2079000">Basically, we have seen two formulas that work in fairly</span> <span m="2083000">generate situations. One of them says -- If S is</span> <span m="2090000">given by an equation z equals some function of x,</span> <span m="2100000">y then you can just say n dS equals minus f sub x,</span> <span m="2106000">minus f sub y, one, dx dy.</span> <span m="2109000">And I need to rewrite that because I am running out of</span> <span m="2114000">space. But, while I erase,</span> <span m="2116000">I would like to point out the most important there in here.</span> <span m="2120000">When I say n dS equals blah, blah, blah times dx dy,</span> <span m="2124000">dx dy is not the same thing as dS at all.</span> <span m="2128000">If you make that mistake you are going to get into trouble</span> <span m="2131000">the next time that you try to buy real estate in a region</span> <span m="2134000">which hills or cliffs or things like that.</span> <span m="2137000">dS is the area on the slanted surface.</span> <span m="2140000">dx dy is the area on the map that shows the x,</span> <span m="2146000">y plane. And these are not the same</span> <span m="2149000">thing. In particular,</span> <span m="2151000">you cannot just take one piece of it and not the other piece.</span> <span m="2160000">Let me give you formulas for n and for dS separately just to</span> <span m="2166000">convince you. That way, if you feel that you</span> <span m="2174000">need them, then you will have them.</span> <span m="2182000">N is minus f sub x, minus f sub y,</span> <span m="2186000">one, but scaled down to unit length.</span> <span m="2191000">This is not a unit vector. It is actually divided by the</span> <span m="2195000">length of this guy which is fx squared plus fy squared plus</span> <span m="2198000">one. And dS is that same vector</span> <span m="2206000">times dx dy. And so the square roots cancel</span> <span m="2212000">out when you multiply them together.</span> <span m="2216000">But it would be completely wrong to just say I will replace</span> <span m="2220000">n dS by minus f sub x, minus f sub y and one.</span> <span m="2223000">Then I end up again with the dS and I do something else with dS.</span> <span m="2227000">That is a pretty bad conceptual mistake because it gives you the</span> <span m="2236000">wrong answer. Another option more general</span> <span m="2240000">than that. If we have not seen how to</span> <span m="2244000">solve for z, how to express z as a function of x and y,</span> <span m="2252000">well, maybe we still know some normal vector to the surface.</span> <span m="2260000">Then there is another formula for n dS which is up to sine,</span> <span m="2269000">N divided by N dot k dx dy. And, see, that projection</span> <span m="2275000">formula works also if you have to project to another coordinate</span> <span m="2278000">plane. For example,</span> <span m="2279000">if you want to project to the x, z coordinate plane,</span> <span m="2282000">the relation between n dS and dx dz is given by N over N dot</span> <span m="2290000">j, because j is the direction</span> <span m="2293000">perpendicular to the xz plane. But this one is more useful.</span> <span m="2299000">What is a good example of that? If you have a slanted plane</span> <span m="2304000">given to you, you can easily find its normal</span> <span m="2308000">vector. That is just given by the</span> <span m="2311000">coefficients of x, y, z in the equation.</span> <span m="2313000">Another situation where that might happen is if your surface</span> <span m="2318000">is given by an equation of a form of g of x,</span> <span m="2321000">y, z equals zero. If that is the case then you</span> <span m="2324000">know this is a level set of g. And we know how to find a</span> <span m="2327000">normal vector to the level set, namely the gradient vector is</span> <span m="2330000">always perpendicular to the level set.</span> <span m="2332000">You would take the gradient of g to be your big N.</span> <span m="2339000">OK. Now, these are basically all</span> <span m="2346000">the integrals we have seen how to set up.</span> <span m="2350000">Now we have a bunch of theorems relating them.</span> <span m="2355000">Let me think about how I am going to organize that.</span> <span m="2363000">Let me try like this. This part of the board will be</span> <span m="2372000">work, this part of the board will be</span> <span m="2375000">about flux and the left part of the board will be about things</span> <span m="2380000">in the plane and the right one will be about things in space.</span> <span m="2386000">What have we seen? Well, we have seen Green's</span> <span m="2393000">theorem for work. That doesn't work so well</span> <span m="2397000">because that is too small, so I am going to actually use</span> <span m="2399000">more blackboards to do that.</span> <span m="2426000">This side will be space, this side will be the plane and</span> <span m="2432000">we are going to start with theorems about work.</span> <span m="2437000">And we will see theorems about flux pretty soon.</span> <span m="2441000">We have two theorems about work. In the plane that is called</span> <span m="2447000">Green's theorem. In space that is called Stokes'</span> <span m="2451000">theorem. Green's theorem says if I have</span> <span m="2456000">a closed curve in the plane going counterclockwise enclosing</span> <span m="2463000">entirely some region R then the line integral along C for the</span> <span m="2471000">work of F is equal to the double integral of a region inside of</span> <span m="2480000">the curl of F dA. Concretely, if my components of</span> <span m="2487000">F are called M and N that is the line integral of M dx plus N dy</span> <span m="2495000">is equal to the double integral of R of N sub x minus M sub y</span> <span m="2503000">dA. This side here is a usual line</span> <span m="2506000">integral. This side here is a usual</span> <span m="2509000">double integral in the plane. And somehow their values end up</span> <span m="2513000">being magically related. Well, not quite magically.</span> <span m="2518000">We actually have seen how to prove it.</span> <span m="2523000">And now the analog of that in space is Stokes' theorem.</span> <span m="2530000">Stokes says if I have a closed curve in space,</span> <span m="2535000">now I have to decide what kind of thing it bounds.</span> <span m="2540000">And the answer is it will have to bound some surface,</span> <span m="2543000">but I have a choice of surface. I choose my favorite surface</span> <span m="2548000">bounded by C. I guess I will just draw it</span> <span m="2551000">like that. And I have to choose a</span> <span m="2553000">compatible orientation. Remember, we have seen this</span> <span m="2556000">right hand rule for choosing how to orient the surface.</span> <span m="2559000">I believe, in this case, if I take C like that then the</span> <span m="2563000">normal vector has to go up. And then it tells me how to</span> <span m="2569000">compute the work done by F along C.</span> <span m="2573000">Namely, that becomes the double integral over that surface S of</span> <span m="2581000">curl F, which I will write as dell cross F dot n dS.</span> <span m="2588000">This line integral is a usual line integral,</span> <span m="2590000">but if for some reason we don't want to compute it directly we</span> <span m="2594000">can actually replace it by a surface integral over any</span> <span m="2598000">surface bounded by the curve. It might be that a problem will</span> <span m="2602000">tell you which surface you have to consider.</span> <span m="2603000">It might be that you will be left to choose the simplest</span> <span m="2608000">possible surface you can think of that is somehow having this</span> <span m="2613000">curve as its boundary. And so now, remember,</span> <span m="2616000">curl of a vector field in space is going to be another vector</span> <span m="2620000">expression. It has three components.</span> <span m="2622000">And the way you compute it is not by remembering the actual</span> <span m="2625000">formula, which is really complicated by,</span> <span m="2628000">but by instead computing the cross-product between dell and</span> <span m="2634000">F. You set up the cross-product.</span> <span m="2641000">And, of course, it is a highly symbolic</span> <span m="2643000">cross-product. I mean it is not an</span> <span m="2647000">cross-product of actual vectors but it works the same way.</span> <span m="2656000">Both of these formulas basically relate work on a curve</span> <span m="2660000">with what happens to the curl on the surface that is enclosed by</span> <span m="2664000">this curve, that is bounded by this curve.</span> <span m="2667000">And in this one you have less freedom of choice because you</span> <span m="2670000">don't have somehow a z direction in which you could move your</span> <span m="2674000">surface. There is only possible choice</span> <span m="2676000">of surface. There is only one thing that is</span> <span m="2679000">enclosed by this curve in the plane.</span> <span m="2682000">In both cases, these things tell you that you</span> <span m="2685000">can think of curl as measuring how much the field fails to be</span> <span m="2688000">conservative. See, if your field was</span> <span m="2691000">conservative -- If a curl was zero then the right-hand side</span> <span m="2695000">would just be zero. And that would be fortunate</span> <span m="2697000">because if a curl is zero then your field is less conservative.</span> <span m="2701000">That means it comes from a potential.</span> <span m="2702000">That means when you go along a closed curve,</span> <span m="2705000">well, the change of value of a potential should be zero.</span> <span m="2709000">Another way to say it is path independence tells you no work.</span> <span m="2713000">And, of course, if you have a vector field that</span> <span m="2716000">is not a gradient field then the curl is not necessarily zero and</span> <span m="2720000">then you get a more interesting answer.</span> <span m="2723000">Finally, let's move onto the theorems about flux.</span> <span m="2727000">That is Green for flux and that is the divergence theorem.</span> <span m="2743000">Flux theorems. Here I say that will be</span> <span m="2754000">divergence. And here it will be Green again.</span> <span m="2761000">Green's theorem for flux says I have a closed curve that goes</span> <span m="2767000">counterclockwise around some region.</span> <span m="2770000">In particular, counterclockwise means that the</span> <span m="2773000">normal vector will be going out of the region.</span> <span m="2776000">And then it tells us that the flux out of the region,</span> <span m="2780000">through the curve C, so that will be the line</span> <span m="2784000">integral of F dot n ds is equal to the integral of a region</span> <span m="2790000">inside of div F dA. And remember the divergence of</span> <span m="2797000">M, N is just Mx plus Ny. This one here,</span> <span m="2802000">the divergence theorem, tells you something similar but</span> <span m="2806000">now for a region of space bounded by a closed surface.</span> <span m="2809000">So if you have some region of space and you call its boundary</span> <span m="2815000">surface S and you let n be the normal vector that goes out of</span> <span m="2820000">the region R. You orient S outwards.</span> <span m="2827000">Then the flux out of the region through S is going to be the</span> <span m="2835000">same as the triple integral over the region of divergence F dV.</span> <span m="2843000">Remember, the divergence of a vector field with components P,</span> <span m="2851000">Q, R is Px plus Qy plus Rz. What do these two theorems say?</span> <span m="2856000">Well, they say essentially the same thing.</span> <span m="2859000">They say the total flux out of a region is equal to the</span> <span m="2863000">integral of divergence over whatever is inside.</span> <span m="2866000">And the reason for that is, again, we have seen for a</span> <span m="2869000">velocity field that divergence measures how much things are</span> <span m="2872000">expanding or how much stuff is being created.</span> <span m="2875000">It tells you the amount of sources per unit portion of the</span> <span m="2879000">region. When you sum that over</span> <span m="2881000">everything, you get the amount of fluid</span> <span m="2883000">that is being, you know, the total amount of</span> <span m="2885000">sources inside here, and that tells us how much</span> <span m="2888000">stuff has to go out per unit time.</span> <span m="2890000">That is basically the interpretation.</span> <span m="2892000">In a way, I would be tempted to say that this table of four</span> <span m="2896000">theorems is somehow the crucial point of 18.02.</span> <span m="2900000">And you would do well to remember them.</span> <span m="2903000">However, I would like also to point out that these theorems</span> <span m="2906000">are completely useless if you don't know how to compute any of</span> <span m="2908000">the integrals that are in there. So all the stuff that was</span> <span m="2911000">around there before is actually somehow more fundamental.</span> <span m="2915000">And if you don't know how to compute the double or triple</span> <span m="2918000">integrals then this is of little use to you.</span> <span m="2921000">That is the end. I guess I have to wish you</span> <span m="2928000">happy holidays.</span> </p>
